## Abstract

Galactic accretion, the process wherein smaller galaxies merge with the Milky Way, has been posited as a plausible explanation for several properties of the present-day Galaxy, including old stars on dynamically hot orbits and the bimodality of chemical composition within the stellar disk. Testing this hypothesis has so far been hindered by our ability to find and characterise accreted stars and their now-dispersed host galaxies. We use a cosmological zoom-in simulation from the NIHAO suite, which now also traces the chemical composition of selected elements, to explore a simulated Milky Way analogue. Comparing the noise-free simulations to noisy and incomplete observations of our Milky Way, provided by the spectroscopic stellar GALAH survey, we assess several diagnostic plots in chemical and age-abundance space to identify accreted stars. We confirm the strength of chemical planes such as [Al/Fe] vs [Mg/Mn], but find a stronger potential for separating accretion events in the age-abundance plane. We analyse the necessary quality of observations to capitalise on this premise and find a significant separation of accreted and in-situ sequences at 68% confidence for 0.2 dex and 15% abundance and age uncertainties, respectively. Once this uncertainty threshold is overcome, we will be able to better identify and characterise accretion in the Milky Wayâ€”confirming the need for more precise ages and abundances, as will be delivered by the second phase of the GALAH survey.
