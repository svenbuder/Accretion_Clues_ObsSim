%Context: 
Galactic accretion, the process wherein smaller galaxies merge with the Milky Way, has been posited as a plausible explanation for several properties of the present-day Galaxy, including old stars on dynamically hot orbits and the bimodality of chemical composition within the stellar disk. Testing this hypothesis has so far been hindered by our ability to find and characterise accreted stars and their now-dispersed host galaxies. We will use a cosmological zoom-in simulation from the NIHAO suite, which now also traces the chemical composition of selected elements, to explore a simulated Milky Way analogue. Comparing the noise-free simulations to noisy and incomplete observations of our Milky Way, provided by the spectroscopic stellar GALAH survey, we assess several diagnostic plots in chemical and age-abundance space to identify accreted stars. We confirm the strength of chemical planes such as [Al/Fe] vs [Mg/Mn], but find a stronger potential for separating accretion events in the age-abundance plane. We therefore analyse the necessary quality of observations to capitalise on this premise and find a significant separation of accreted and in-situ sequences at 68\% confidence for 0.15 dex and 20\% abundance and age uncertainties, respectively. Once this uncertainty threshold is overcome, we will be able to better identify and characterise accretion in the Milky Way—confirming the need for more precise ages and abundances, as will be delivered by the second phase of the GALAH survey.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

The history of the Milky Way is a puzzle that has taunted astronomers for decades. The long lifetimes and rather conserved chemical composition of stars makes them key pieces in this puzzle, allowing us to use their star light as fossil record to gain insights into the historical processes that have led to our Galaxy as we know it today \citep{FreemanBlandHawthorn2002}. The advent of new large-scale stellar surveys, providing a wealth of information including measurements of elemental abundances\footnote{We define elemental abundances, such as [Fe/H], [Mg/Fe], and [Mg/Mn] as logarithmic ratios of two elemental number densities $N_\text{X}$ and $N_\text{Y}$ compared to the Sun, that is, $\left[\text{X/Y}\right]=\log_{10}\left(\frac{N_\text{X}}{N_\text{Y}}\right) -\log_{10}\left(\frac{N_\text{X}}{N_\text{Y}}\right)_\odot$.} for millions of stars, has enabled insights into the long and complex history of our Galaxy that have been previously unattainable \citep{Jofre2019}. Astrometric information for more than 1.5 billion stars from the \Gaia satellite \citep{Brown2016,Brown2018,Brown2021} has given us a new understanding of the structure of our Galaxy, while spectroscopic surveys like the Galactic Archaeology with HERMES (GALAH) Survey \citep{daSilva2015} and the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment \citep[APOGEE,][]{Majewski2016} are complementing this vision with chemical fingerprints for millions of stars. Most notably, these surveys have led to the confirmation of a major accretion event around 8-10 billions years ago by \citet{Belokurov2018} and \citet{Helmi2018}. While this major merger of the \Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE) and the early Milky Way could explain the bimodality of stars in the Milky Ways disk, the causality is yet to be established beyond doubt. Our best avenue is to quantify the chemical and dynamical properties of accreted stars to answer outstanding questions like how much gas the GSE merger brought in to explain the significantly different chemistry of young versus old disk stars.

From our vantage point within the disk-dominated region of the Milky Way, it is difficult to identify the relatively low number of accreted stars. Intensive research has tested a variety of ways to find such stars - an extensive list of which is presented by \citet{Buder2022}. A first impulse was given by the series of papers by \citet{Nissen2010, Nissen2011, Nissen2014} and \citet{Schuster2012} that analysed the chemistry of stars in the kinematic halo of the Milky Way. They identified a population within the Galactic halo that showed significantly lower enhancements across a number of elements, hinting to an extra-Galactic origin. Starting from dynamic arguments, \citet{Belokurov2018} and \citet{Helmi2018} rediscovered this population as stars with outstanding eccentric and radial orbits and proved its significance via dynamical simulations and chemical evolution arguments. Peaking further into the halo, \citet{Naidu2020} then showed that the halo is entirely compromised of substructure, including accreted stars. Studies of extragalactic sources can now also spatially resolve these source broadly and use age-metallicity relations to identify accreted stars \citep{Martig2021}, with tens of edge-on galaxies being observed by the MUSE integral field spectrograph through large programs like GECKOS \citep{GECKOS2023}. Such analyses are however limited by the fact that spatial and dynamical selections are less robust in a spatially and dynamically evolving galaxy over billions of years.

The key advantage of chemical tagging, when compared to dynamical tagging via velocities or energies, is that the composition of heavy elements, once locked in the atmosphere of a star, is expected to be much more conserved in a dynamically evolving galaxy. Building upon this premise, \citet{Hawkins2015}, \citet{Das2020} and \citet{Buder2022} assessed a number of potential abundance combinations for chemically tagging accreted stars. Among the many elements in the periodic table, they identified especially Na, Al, and Cu as exceptionally useful, if they can be measured. Using these elements together with the purer tracers of core-collapse supernovae (CCSN), like Mg, and supernovae type Ia (SNIa), like Mn, they found the abundance planes of [Na/Fe] vs. [Mg/Mn] and [Al/Fe] vs. [Mg/Mn] to reveal accreted stars in rather isolated loci.

Ages and abundances are, however, not directly observable and difficult to obtain from stellar spectra and any age-inference tool. Significant progress has been made in terms of the number and quality of observations, but we are still limited by our ability to observe a significant number of accreted stars with accurate and precise ages and abundances. While the GALAH survey can for example measure Na abundances, it is particularly difficult to measure Al abundances from its spectra. The observed stellar ages of GALAH DR3 are even more uncertain - with an average age uncertainty of $33\pm20\%$. Cosmological simulations, such as those used in this study, carry no age uncertainties and the particular simulation \citep{Buck2021} we use here, introduced in Sec.~\ref{sec:sim_data}, now also includes chemical abundance information. This provides an exceptional data set for exploring both the theoretically expected impact of massive mergers on the chemical evolution of Milky Way-like galaxies \citep{Buck2023} as well as our observational diagnostic tools, without uncertainty margins to consider.

The aim of this project is to assess diagnostic tools for identifying accreted structures from observations in the Milky Way by comparing them with theoretical predictions from cosmological simulations. This assessment will be based on our ability to observe and quantify clear patterns and trends. In addition to testing chemical tagging, that is, relying only on abundances, we also test the use of age-abundance planes and make predictions on the necessary uncertainties for the diagnostic properties when assuming the Milky Way analogue as ground truth.

The paper is structured as follows: Sec.~\ref{sec:data} describes the data of NIHAO simulations and GALAH observations. Sec ~\ref{sec:comparison} performs an initial comparison of diagnostic plots, using different abundance planes. Sec ~\ref{sec:Age-abundance} instead considers how stellar abundance changes over time, and quantifies the results. Sec ~\ref{sec:discussion} discusses the findings and their implications.

\section{Data: Chemical abundances from observations and simulations} \label{sec:data}

\subsection{Observational data from the GALAH Survey}\label{sec:obs_data}

Observations are provided through the GALactic Archaeology with HERMES (GALAH) survey. For our study, we use the abundance measurements from the third data release (DR3) of the GALAH Survey with its 588,571 stars \citep{Buder2021}. The main program of the survey targets nearby stars via their visual magnitudes (typically $9 < V < 12$ and $12 < V < 14$) while neglecting the Galactic plane ($\vert b \vert > 10\,\mathrm{deg}$). However, the data release also includes auxiliary programs of the K2 and TESS footprints \citep{Sharma2018, Sharma2019} as well as open and globular clusters \cite[for more details see][]{Buder2021}. Stars were targeted with the 2dF fibre optics positioner system at the Anglo-Australian Telescope \citep{Heijmans2012, Farrell2014} and the light of up to 400 stars was simultaneously fed into the High Efficiency and Resolution Multi-Element Spectrograph \citep[HERMES,][]{Barden2010, Sheinis2015}. HERMES delivers high-resolution ($R \sim 28,000$) spectra in four wavelength bands across the optical range which were reduced with the pipeline by \citep{Kos2017}.

Stellar parameters ($T_\text{eff}$, $\log g$, [Fe/H], $v_\text{mic}$, $v_\text{broad}$, and $v_\text{rad}$) and abundances for up to 31\footnote{Li*, C*, O*, Na*, Mg*, Al*, Si*, K*, Ca*, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn*, Fe*, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Rb, Sr, Y, Zr, Mo, Ru, Ba*, La, Ce, Nd, Sm, and Eu, with * denoting elements calculated not in 1D in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE), but 1D non-LTE.} different elements across multiple nucleosynthesis channels are estimated using a modified version of the spectrum synthesis code Spectroscopy Made Easy \citep[\textsc{sme}][]{Valenti1996, Piskunov2017} and 1D \textsc{marcs} model atmospheres \citep{Gustafsson2008}. Eleven elements are computed in non-LTE \citep{Amarsi2020}, the others in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE), and additional constraints on the surface gravities are incorporated through inferred distances by \citet{BailerJones2021} and their limit on absolute magnitudes and luminosities.

In addition to the chemical information, we use the crossmatches of stars with value-added-catalog for stellar ages. The latter incorporates photometric and astrometric information from \Gaia eDR3 \citep{Lindegren2021a} and 2MASS \citep{Skrutskie2006} to estimate isochrone ages with the \textsc{bstep} code \citep{Sharma2018}.

We apply the following general quality and selection cuts to the data, firstly $\texttt{flag\_repeat} = 0$ to get one measurement per star, and secondly $\texttt{flag\_sp} = 0$, $\texttt{flag\_fe\_h} = 0$, $\texttt{flag\_Mg\_fe} = 0$, $\texttt{snr\_c2\_iraf} > 25$, and $\mathrm{[Fe/H]} > -2$ to get the most reliable stellar parameters while maintaining a sufficient amount of stars. Whenever we use additional elemental abundances of an element X, we also enforce $\texttt{flag\_X\_fe} = 0$.

While we have considered enforcing \textsc{bstep} age uncertainties below 50\%, we have decided against implementing a sharp limit, both to avoid complex influences\footnote{Of the \input{tex_text/age_above_8gyr.tex} stars above $8\,\mathrm{Gyr}$ \input{tex_text/age_above_8gyr_above50perc_ageunc}, \input{tex_text/age_above_8gyr_above40perc_ageunc}, and \input{tex_text/age_above_8gyr_above30perc_ageunc} have uncertainties above $50\%$, $40\%$, and $30\%$, respectively. Of the \input{tex_text/age_below_8gyr.tex} stars below $8\,\mathrm{Gyr}$ already \input{tex_text/age_below_8gyr_above50perc_ageunc.tex} have uncertainties above $50\%$.} in the selection function and because it does not significantly impact the stars with ages above $8\,\mathrm{Gyr}$.

To allow better comparability with the simulations lateron (see Sec.~\ref{sec:location}), we also limit our sample to stars with Galactic latitude $\vert b \vert > 10\,\mathrm{deg}$ and distance $D_\varpi < 4.2\,\mathrm{kpc}$, the 95th distance percentile of GALAH DR3 \citep{Buder2021}. After applying all these cuts, our sample still consists of \input{tex_text/nr_stars_in_galah_after_cuts}stars, allowing a statistically meaningful comparison with theoretical predictions.

\subsection{Theoretical predictions from a NIHAO Zoom-in simulation}\label{sec:sim_data}

The model perspective on accretion is provided through a cosmological zoom-in simulation of a Milky Way analogue (\texttt{g8.26e11}) from the \textit{Numerical Investigation of a Hundred Astronomical Objects} \citep[NIHAO,][]{Wang2015}. The total mass of $8.26 \cdot 10^{11}\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$ contains $4 \cdot 10^{10}\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$ stellar mass with a stellar mass resolution of $1.06 \cdot 10^{5}\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$ \citep{Buck2021} and was calculated as part of the NIHAO-UHD project \citep{Buck2020b}.

Simulations were carried out with the smoothed particle hydrodynamics code \texttt{Gasoline2} \citep{Wadsley2017} starting from the cosmological parameters from \citet{Planck2014} with initial conditions and energetic feedback descriptions from the NIHAO project \citep{Wang2015}. Zoom-in simulations were then performed as described in detail by \citet{Buck2021} with star formation following \citet{Stinson2006} and feedback following \citet{Stinson2013}.

Because computational resource still limits the mass resolution of simulations, we are relying on tracer particles that represent simple stellar populations (SSPs) with the same age, overall metallicity and discrete initial mass function (IMF). \citet{Buck2021} have implemented the flexible chemical evolution code \textsc{chempy} \citep{Rybizki2017} to calculate the chemical yields for the SSPs. In particular, we use the alternative (\texttt{alt}) setup of \textsc{chempy} that assumes a \citet{Chabrier2003} IMF with high-mass slope of $\alpha_\text{IMF} = -2.3$ over a mass range of $0.1-100\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$ for SSPs across a metallicity range of $Z/Z_\odot \in [10^{-5},2]$. The code calculates the contribution from asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars, CCSN across a mass range of $8-40\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$, and SNIa with a an exponential function with exponent $-1.12$, a delay time of $40\,\mathrm{Myr}$, and a normalization of the SNI rate of -2.9. For each of these nucleosynthetic channels, yields from the following studies are used: \citet{Limongi2018} for CCSN, \citet{Seitenzahl2013} for SNIa, and \citet{Karakas2016} for AGB stars.

To achieve a roughly similar selection as the observational data (see Secs.~\ref{sec:obs_data} and \ref{sec:location}), while maintaining enough star particles, we limit the simulated data set to star particles within a torus at $8.2\,\mathrm{kpc}$ galactocentric radius with a $4.2\,\mathrm{kpc}$ tube radius (corresponding to the 95th distance percentile of the GALAH sample) and neglect star particles within $\vert b \vert~<~10\,\mathrm{deg}$ or $\mathrm{[Fe/H]} < -2$. We 
use the last simulation snapshot time of $14.14\,\mathrm{Gyr}$ to estimate the ages from the reported formation time.

The simulation traces the elemental abundances of H, He, C, N, O, Ne, Mg, Al, Si, P, S, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, and Ba. Of these, ten correspond with the GALAH data and allow us to compare diagnostic plots possible with abundances of C, O, Mg, Al, Si, V, Cr, Mn, Co and Ba. To allow a better comparison of simulated to observed abundance patterns, we shift the abundance patterns [X/H] by the values listed in Table~\ref{tab:shift_4to5gyr}, such that the median abundance for [X/H] is Solar for the stars with ages of Solar age ($4-5\,\mathrm{Gyr}$) in the GALAH-like footprint of the Milky Way analogue.

The simulation record galactocentric Cartesian positions $(X,Y,Z)$ and velocities $(V_X,V_Y,V_Z)$ for each particle, which we transform into a galactocentric Cylindrical coordinate frame via
\begin{align}
    R = \sqrt{X^2 + Y^2} \qquad &\& \qquad V_R = \frac{X*V_X + Y*V_Y}{R} \\
    \phi = \arctan(X/Y) \qquad &\& \qquad V_\phi = \frac{-Y*V_X + X*V_Y}{R} \\
    z = Z  \qquad &\& \qquad V_z = V_Z,
\end{align}
while using the \textsc{numpy} \textsc{arctan2} package.

\section{Diagnostic plots: Observation vs. Simulation}
\label{sec:comparison}

In Sec.~\ref{sec:intro}, we have reviewed several observation-based plots that have been used to identify accreted stars in the Milky Way. In this section, we are now assessing if the simulated Milky Way analogue shows similar signatures when using these diagnostic plots. In Sec.~\ref{sec:location}, we first analyse the major diagnostic plots ([Fe/H] vs. [Si/Fe], [Al/Fe] vs. [Mg/Mn], and Age vs. [Fe/H]) while focusing on their difference for the full galaxy and a GALAH-like footprint of it. We then focus on the general abundance trends with iron abundance in Sec.~\ref{sec:feh_xfe}, before zeroing in on abundance-abundance plance of [Al/Fe] vs. [Mg/Mn] in Sec.~\ref{sec:alfe_mgmn}.

\begin{figure}

    \label{fig:low_alpha_halo}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Location matters: Full galaxy versus Solar neighborhood} \label{sec:location}

Naïvely, we initially plot the diagnostic plots of observers, namely the ratio of CCSN to SNIa via [Si/Fe] as function of iron abundance [Fe/H] in Fig.~\ref{fig:low_alpha_halo}a as well as the previously successful selection plane of [Al/Fe] vs. [Mg/Mn] in Fig.~\ref{fig:low_alpha_halo}b for the complete Milky Way analogue. In the absence of observational noise, it could be expected that areas of in-situ and accreted stars might clearly separate. To the contrary, the [Al/Fe] vs. [Mg/Mn] for the whole galaxy show seemingly even more scatter than the observations when inspecting the whole galaxy. Tracing the selection of accreted stars, that is, the stars with lower [Si/Fe] around $-0.90 < \mathrm{[Fe/H]} < -0.65$ with a selection box, does not lead to a unique location in the [Al/Fe] vs. [Mg/Mn] in Fig.~\ref{fig:low_alpha_halo}b when showing the extend of these stars with a convex hull outline. While this may seem surprising for observers at first sight, it has been seen previously also in the \textsc{VINTERGATAN} simulations, when \citet[][see their Fig.~A2]{Rey2023} traced different merger subpopulations.

When applying a similar selection to NIHAO as would be expected from GALAH observations in the Solar vicinity (see Sec.~\ref{sec:sim_data}), both the [Fe/H] vs. [Si/Fe] plane in Fig.~\ref{fig:low_alpha_halo}d as well as the [Al/Fe] vs. [Mg/Mn] plane in Fig.~\ref{fig:low_alpha_halo}e cleared up significantly, with the accreted sequence becoming more prominent around $\mathrm{[Al/Fe]}$ of -0.3.

\begin{figure*}
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/Overview_FeH_XFe_Obs_Sim.png}
    \caption{
    \textbf{Logarithmic density distribution of elemental abundances [X/Fe] versus [Fe/H] for the ten elements overlapping between GALAH and NIHAO.} 
    \textbf{First and third rows} show observed data from GALAH while \textbf{second and fourth rows} show the simulated data for the same abundance ratios in a GALAH-like footprint. Brighter colors (towards yellow) indicate higher densities. For better visibility, plot ranges are adjusted to the data rather than to be equal among each panel. Dashed lines indicate Solar values. Simulated abundance trends for N, Ne, P, and S are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:appendix_feh_xfe_nneps}.}
    \label{fig:FeH_XFe}
\end{figure*}

Intrigued by the difference in clarity of the chemical planes, we also show the two age-metallicity relations - or more accurately age-[Fe/H] planes - for the full Milky Way analogue in Fig.~\ref{fig:low_alpha_halo}c and the observational footprint in Fig.~\ref{fig:low_alpha_halo}f. The clearly arising separations of sequences in both selections motivates a more dedicated analysis of this plane, as will follow in Sec.~\ref{sec:Age-abundance}. Under this section's theme of identifying differences in the planes of full and limited sample selection, we notice a slightly larger scatter of abundances in Fig.~\ref{fig:low_alpha_halo}c, that is, a differences of iron abundances outside the Solar vicinity, as well as the disappearance of a metal-poor ($\mathrm{[Fe/H]} \sim -1.5$) sequence below $10\,\mathrm{Gyr}$ when limiting the selection to the GALAH footprint.

\textbf{Key Takeaway:} Location matters, or better: a clever sample selection - even for simulations!

\subsection{Abundance trends: [Fe/H] vs. [X/Fe]} \label{sec:feh_xfe}

In Fig.~\ref{fig:FeH_XFe}, we show the elemental abundances [X/Fe] as a function of iron abundance [Fe/H] of the 10 elements X that overlap between GALAH observations and NIHAO simulations. To first order we see an agreement of general trends for most elements, that is, elements that are produced by CCSN like O, Mg, and Si are showing a high plateau for low [Fe/H] and a decrease towards higher iron abundances - as expected by the onset of Fe-producing SNIa. The iron-peak elements Cr as well as Mn and Co show increasing abundances from low values at low [Fe/H] towards solar values at solar [Fe/H]. Abundance estimates for V and Co do not agree, which is partially (but not fully) caused by unreliably high measurements of [V/Fe] and [Co/Fe] in GALAH \citet{Buder2021}. For Ba, we note tightly increasing enhancements towards Solar [Fe/H], starting from initially low values around $\mathrm{[Ba/Fe]} \sim -0.5$. Furthermore, we notice a clear second (accreted) sequences below $\mathrm{[Fe/H]} < -0.5$ for C as well as Ba. While not shown in this manuscript, we note that when plotting the full simulated galaxy in Fig.~\ref{fig:FeH_XFe}, no significant difference in trends can be identified, but a larger spread of abundances - most notably towards the lowest metallicities.

When focusing on the actual absolute abundances (note the difference in y-axis), we note significant differences between the chemical evolution sequences. To understand this difference, we first need to remind ourselves that the observational data is limited by the ability to measure abundances (note the missing abundances of [C/Fe] for low metallicities due to detection limits) and includes measurement noise, while the theoretical data does not necessarily have to reproduce the formation scenario of the Milky Way and chemical enrichment tracing is limited to our best current understanding of nucleosynthesis, see e.g. the discussion of nucleosynthetic yields in \citet{Buck2021}.

That said, we note that none of the abundance sequences in the Solar metallicity regime of $\mathrm{[Fe/H]} \sim 0$ intercept with the expected Solar value. While C, O, Si, Cr, Mn, and Ba are significantly overproduced between $0.05$ (for Cr) and $0.5\,\mathrm{dex}$ (for Ba), we notice a significant under-abundance on the $-0.3..-0.1\,\mathrm{dex}$ level for Mg, Al, V, and Co.

\textbf{Key Takeaway:} While simple abundance-metallicity plots do not easily reveal accreted structures for most elements, both C and Ba abundances show the potential to identify different abundance sequences - if the nucleosynthetic processes of the simulation are accurate.

\subsection{Abundance-abundance plots: [Al/Fe] vs. [Mg/Mn]} \label{sec:alfe_mgmn}

We now turn then to abundance-abundance plots of [Al/Fe] vs. [Mg/Mn] that were already mentioned in Sec.~\ref{sec:location}. These plots combine the enrichment channels of CCSN vs. SNIa, that is [Mg/Mn], and the enrichment of Al with more complex metallicity-dependent enrichment pathways \citep{Hawkins2015, Das2020, Kobayashi2020}. The enhancements of these elements should differ significantly when comparing in-situ stars born in the early Milky Way with the less massive system that it accreted because of the expected lower star formation intensity (and thus iron abundance) and occurrence of CCSN in the latter. 

\begin{figure}
	\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{figures/mgmn_alfe.png}
    \caption{
    \textbf{Comparison of the diagnostic plot of odd-Z elements [Al/Fe] or [Na/Fe] vs. the ratio of CCSN and SNIa elements [Mg/Mn] in simulation (top) and observation (bottom), with accreted stars being expected in the upper left of the distributions.}
    \textbf{Left panels a and c} use the same axis limits, whereas \textbf{panel b} is a zoomed version of the simulation. \textbf{Panel d} complements the picture, as [Al/Fe] is hard to measure in GALAH (see missing data points in top left of panel c).
    }
    \label{fig:NaFe_MgMn_selection_Age_FeH_dissection}
\end{figure}

When using the same axis limits for simulation and observation (Figs.~\ref{fig:NaFe_MgMn_selection_Age_FeH_dissection}a and c), we notice the strong offset and significantly smaller spread of abundances in the simulation, in agreement with our previous findings for abundances in Sec.~\ref{sec:feh_xfe}. When zooming into the relevant [Al/Fe] vs. [Mg/Mn] regime for the simulations, however, we notice a better qualitative agreement, in that we see two significant overdensities for simulated and observed galaxy. For the observations, we identify the lower and upper overdensity at [Mg/Mn] of 0.0 and 0.4. These have previously been confirmed as low- and high-$\upalpha$-sequence (or thin and thick disk), respectively \citep{Hawkins2015, Buder2022}. These sequences show similar Solar or even enhanced [Na/Fe] and [Al/Fe]. In contrast to this, the major overdensity in the simulation is found around (-0.25,-0.5) with tails reaching higher [Mg/Mn]. The minor overdensity is found towards higher [Mg/Mn] as well as lower [Al/Fe] - coinciding with the expected region of accreted stars \citep{Horta2021} which are less numerous in the observational data of GALAH DR3.

\textbf{Key Takeaway:} The abundance-abundance plot of [Al/Fe] vs. [Mg/Mn] show qualitative agreement with the observational data, but with significant abundance offsets and a more pronounced overdensity of accreted stars than the observations. This could indicate a more massive merger progenitor than the Milky Way's GSE or hint at our inability to actually measure Mg, Mn, and Al or Na abundances of accreted stars.

\section{A new (?) angle: age-abundance-distributions}\label{sec:Age-abundance}

Fortunately, chemistry is not the only conserved property of stars. We therefore turn to stellar ages and assess age-abundance trends in the data, starting from the age-[Fe/H] relationship that we already showed in Figs.~\ref{fig:low_alpha_halo}c and f. This relation has proven to be a powerful tool not only for resolving processes with observed data of our Milky Way \citep[e.g.][]{Twarog1980, Edvardsson1993, Nordstroem2004, Casagrande2011, Feuillet2019, Xiang2022}, but also other galaxies - for example to identify accreted stars \citep[e.g.][]{Pinna2019b, Martig2021}. However, observations still suffer from incredibly large uncertainties on the order of $15-50\%$ for most stars, so examining simulation plots removes this barrier and allow us to determine chemical enrichment as a function of age.

\subsection{Clearly separated sequences in the age-[Fe/H] relation of the Milky Way analogue} \label{sec:age-feh-sequences}

Based on Fig.~\ref{fig:low_alpha_halo}f, we identify two definite and one tentative sequence in the age-metallicity relation with the following selections, selecting \input{tex_text/sequence_particles.tex}:
\begin{align}
    \text{Sequence~1} &= \begin{cases}
        \mathrm{[Fe/H] > -0.2} \text{ or} \\
        (\mathrm{[Fe/H]} > -1.0 \text{ and } \mathrm{age} < 7\,\mathrm{Gyr}) \text{ or} \\
        10^{\mathrm{[Fe/H]} + 0.35} > 2.0 - 0.15*\mathrm{age}~/~\mathrm{Gyr}
    \end{cases} \label{eq:sequence1} \\
    \text{Sequence~2} &= \begin{cases}
        \text{Not Sequence~1 and }\mathrm{Age} > 6\,\mathrm{Gyr} \text{ and} \\
        10^{\mathrm{[Fe/H]} + 0.45} > 1.87 - 0.15*\mathrm{Age}~/~\mathrm{Gyr}
    \end{cases}  \label{eq:sequence2} \\
    \text{Sequence~3} &= \text{Not Seq.~2 and not Seq.~3 and } \mathrm{age} > 7~/~\mathrm{Gyr}  \label{eq:sequence3}
\end{align}

\begin{figure*}

    }
    \label{fig:three_sequences_traced}
\end{figure*}

In Fig.~\ref{fig:three_sequences_traced}, we trace three sequences in separate rows in their chronochemodynamic properties, starting with the age-[Fe/H] relation.

For Sequence~1, the most metal-rich sequence with \input{tex_text/sequence_1_fraction} of particles in the footprint, we see the stars being distributed closest to the galactic plane ($\vert Z \vert < 2\,\mathrm{kpc}$) in Fig.~\ref{fig:three_sequences_traced}b. Their kinematics in Fig.~\ref{fig:three_sequences_traced}c) likens a Toomre diagram of the Milky Way  \citep[][see their Fig.~1a]{Helmi2018} but with a smoother transition of thin and thick disk. The smooth transition of thin and thick disk in kinematic space could lead to the question if the Milky Way analogue truly has a thick disk \citep[see][who raised the same question for the actual Milky Way]{Bovy2012b}. This impression is confirmed in chemical space of [Fe/H] vs. [Si/Fe] in Fig.~\ref{fig:three_sequences_traced}d with its smooth sequence from higher $\mathrm{[Si/Fe]} \sim 0.3$ at $\mathrm{[Fe/H] \sim -1}$ to $\mathrm{[Si/Fe]} \sim 0.2$ at $\mathrm{[Fe/H] \sim 0}$. Similarly, we see a smooth distribution with highest $\mathrm{[Al/Fe]} \sim -0.22$ in the [Al/Fe] vs. [Mg/Mn] plane. We refrain from further dissecting this population in old and young sequence to establish a thin and thick disk as this is not the focus of this work.

Sequence~2 with \input{tex_text/sequence_2_fraction} of particles in the footprint shows the behaviour of kinematic halo stars with a spatial distribution not restricted to the galactic plane (Fig.~\ref{fig:three_sequences_traced}g). While \citet{Buder2022} found $V_\phi = {20}_{-70}^{+100}\,\mathrm{kpc\,km\,s^{-1}}$ when selecting the major accretion remnant in the Milky Way via chemical compositions, we find significantly prograde orbits with \input{tex_text/v_phi_sequence_2} (Fig.~\ref{fig:three_sequences_traced}h), suggesting a net rotation almost as large as the rotation of sequence 1 (\input{tex_text/v_phi_sequence_1}). Once again, we notice the offset towards lower abundance enhancement of this sequence in the [Fe/H] vs. [Si/Fe] plane as well as the [Al/Fe] vs. [Mg/Mn] plane with respect to sequence 1 (Figs.~\ref{fig:three_sequences_traced}i and j, respectively).

Finally, we notice that the smallest Sequence~3 (only \input{tex_text/sequence_3_fraction} of the stars in the footprint) significantly overlaps with Sequence~2 in all of the chronochemodynamic properties. In addition to the very clear separation in age-abundance space (Fig.~\ref{fig:three_sequences_traced}k), the only way to identify particles of this sequence would be through their relative overdensities in the abundance-abundance planes (Figs.~\ref{fig:three_sequences_traced}n and o).

\textbf{Key Takeaway:} We find a smooth transition of thin and thick disk (identified as Sequence 1) of the Milky Way analogue in Figs.~\ref{fig:three_sequences_traced}a-e. Sequence 2 clearly presents itself as an accreted sequence in any of the plots of Figs.~\ref{fig:three_sequences_traced}f-j. In particular, the dominance of the thin/thick disk makes it hart to identify halo stars in spatial and kinematic space, wheres age-abundance and abundance-abundance plots show less contamination. Finally, we note that the smallest sequence (with lowest [Fe/H] values) is overlapping with the major accreted sequence spatially, kinematically, and chemically, and can only be separated as clump in the age-abundance (Fig.~\ref{fig:three_sequences_traced}k) or abundance-abundance space (Figs.~\ref{fig:three_sequences_traced}n and o). Having established the age-abundance planes as the best diagnostic plane (in the absence of measurement uncertainties), we are now concerned with the information held in age-abundance relations beyond the age-[Fe/H] relation.

\subsection{Age-abundance relations beyond age-[Fe/H]} \label{sec:age-abundance-sequences}

Given the various abundance distributions in the [Fe/H] vs. [X/Fe] space from Fig.~\ref{fig:FeH_XFe}, we are now interested in the trends for different elements with age. Previous research has suggested that not necessarily [X/Fe], but [X/H] may be a better tracer of accreted stars \citep[e.g.][for {[Mg/H]}]{Fuhrmann2017, Feuillet2021}. Furthermore, we are inspired by the work by \citet{Weinberg2019, Weinberg2021} as well as \cite{Griffith2019, Griffith2022}, who modeled nucleosynthetic contributions by SNIa and CCSN with a amplitudes such as $A_\text{cc} = 10^\mathrm{[Mg/H]}$ \citep{Weinberg2019}. To avoid confusion with both the abundance notation $A(\mathrm{X})$ and their notation $A_\mathrm{cc}$/$A_\mathrm{Ia}$, we want to explicitly lay out our notation of rewriting the element abundances in a linear way as $N_\text{X/H}$, so that they are linearly proportional to the ratio of number densities $N_\text{X}/N_\text{H}$:
\begin{align}
    \left[\text{X/H}\right] \varpropto \log_{10}\left(\frac{N_\text{X}}{N_\text{H}}\right) \quad \Rightarrow \quad N_\text{X/H} = 10^{\mathrm{[X/H]}} \varpropto \frac{N_\text{X}}{N_\text{H}}
\end{align}

\end{figure*}

\subsubsection{Age-[X/Fe] or age-[X/H] or age-$N_{X/H}$?}

In Fig.~\ref{fig:age_xfe_xh_nxh} we show the age-abundance distributions for six of the elements overlapping between NIHAO and GALAH, namely C, O, Mg, Al, Mn, and Ba. The other abundance trends are appended in Fig.~\ref{fig:appendix_xfe_xh_nx} as their trends liken those already shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:age_xfe_xh_nxh} and they thus do not add new insights.

First, we discuss the top panels of Fig.~\ref{fig:age_xfe_xh_nxh}s showing the age-[X/Fe] trends. As pointed out in our description of Fig.~\ref{fig:FeH_XFe}, the NIHAO simulation show an rather flat, enhanced [C/Fe] abundance for accreted stars, that is, $\mathrm{[C/Fe]} \sim 0.11$ compared to  $\mathrm{[C/Fe]} < 0.07$ at around $10\,\mathrm{Gyr}$. For O in Fig.~\ref{fig:age_xfe_xh_nxh}b, we notice a decrease of high [O/Fe] abundance with decreasing stellar age and an emergine bifurcation with higher $\mathrm{[O/Fe]} \sim 0.1$ for accreted stars. For Mg, the in-situ and accreted components overlap in the age-[Mg/Fe] plane (Fig.~\ref{fig:age_xfe_xh_nxh}c). For both [Al/Fe] and [Mn/Fe], we see $~0.05\,\mathrm{dex}$ lower abundance for accreted stars than for in-situ stars, with a clearer separation of sequences for [Al/Fe] at oldest ages. Finally, the [Ba/Fe] plane shows a lower initial abundance of [Ba/Fe] at oldest ages, which is expected - at least qualitatively - due to the delay of Ba-production by AGB stars \citep{Karakas2016}. We note here that the production of Ba relative to Fe for accreted stars actually surpasses those of in-situ ones, as can be seen from the crossing of Sequence 1 and 2 in Fig.~\ref{fig:age_xfe_xh_nxh}f at around $9\,\mathrm{Gyr}$. At face value, these differences would exclude both the age-[Mg/Fe] and age-[Ba/Fe] plane as useful diagnostics, whereas all other elements show offsets in the age-[X/Fe] plane for at least the youngest ($8-11\,\mathrm{Gyr}$) accreted stars.

Moving towards the age-[X/H] plane in the middle row of Fig.~\ref{fig:age_xfe_xh_nxh}, we notice a very similar qualitative behaviour of all elements. However, we note that the separation of accreted and in-situ sequences in this plane is roughly five times larger, that is, around $0.5\,\mathrm{dex}$, than in the age-[X/Fe] plane. Finally, we consider the age-$N_\mathrm{X/H}$ plane in the bottom rows of Fig.~\ref{fig:age_xfe_xh_nxh}, where we again see a qualitatively similar trend. When focusing on the accreted sequence, we note a roughly linear enhancement of $N_\mathrm{X/H}$ for all elements except for Ba, which show an increasingly enhance curve towards younger ages, in line with an expected increase of Ba-production by AGB stars \citep{Karakas2016}. The difference between sequences starts very small at oldest ages, but then increases to $\Delta N_\mathrm{X/H} \sim 0.7$ around $8\,\mathrm{Gyr}$. While it is not the focus of this particular work, we want to note the increase in scatter of the in-situ age-abundance sequence, most notably in $N_\mathrm{X/H}$, for in-situ stars younger than the oldest accreted stars. This pattern has already been recognised in previous work on NIHAO-UHD simulations \citep[e.g.][]{Lu2022} and was connected with the time of disc formation for several Milky Way analogues. While \citep{Lu2022} identified the strong correlation with disc formation time (see their red lines in their Fig.~1), they also noted a correlation with major mergers \citep[][see their orange lines in Fig.~1]{Lu2022}. The analysis of different simulation snapshots is beyond the scope of this work. But for completeness we want to note the strikingly coinciding times of the onset of scatter in the in-situ sequence and end of star formation in the accreted sequence for the NIHAO-UHD Milky Way analogue of our study, \texttt{g8.26e11}.

    \label{fig:histograms_xh_in_age_bins_Mn}
\end{figure*}

Returning to the main focus of this work, that is, to better identifying accreted stars in observations, we have created Fig.~\ref{fig:age_xfe_xh_nxh_galah} with observational data from the GALAH survey (Sec.~\ref{sec:obs_data}). While we see similarities between observations and simulated age-abundance trends for several elements, other elements show different behaviour. In particular, the measurements of C in GALAH are less numerous for older stars. This is expected based on the difficulty of measuring C from the atomic CI line. We will therefore refrain from a comparison for this element. For O, Mg, and Al, we see an increase of [X/Fe] towards old ages, For Al (Fig.~\ref{fig:age_xfe_xh_nxh_galah}d), this is contrary to the trend of the simulations (Fig.~\ref{fig:age_xfe_xh_nxh}d). The plots with respect to [X/H] are rather flat and inconclusive. For Mn, we see a decrease of both [Mn/Fe] and [Mn/H] towards old ages, in agreement with the simulation. For Ba, we see a decrease of both [Ba/Fe] and [Ba/H] towards old ages - in agreement with the simulations, but even more interestingly the hint of an overdensity of high $\mathrm{[Ba/Fe]} \sim 0.2$ and low $\mathrm{[Ba/H]} \sim -0.6$ around $9\,\mathrm{Gyr}$. This unique behavior is also seen in the simulations - and also only for Mn. When looking at the age-$N_\mathrm{X/H}$ plots in the lower row of Fig.~\ref{fig:age_xfe_xh_nxh_galah}, we identify the aforementioned overdensities again for $N_\mathrm{Ba/H}$ at $9\,\mathrm{Gyr}$, but also $N_\mathrm{Mn/H}$ (Fig.~\ref{fig:age_xfe_xh_nxh_galah}r), whereas the other elements C, O, Mg, and Al do not reach the regime of $N_\mathrm{X/H} < 0.4$ in larger numbers.

\textbf{Key Takeaway:} Across the different age bins, we find Gaussian distributions of abundances in the {[X/Fe]} and {[X/H]} space. At face value, the abundance vs age plots are separated most clearly when the abundance are noted relative to H rather than Fe. Establishing the relationships relative to the number density $N_{X/H}$ should also be explored in future work as they bear to potential to allow the tracing of trace linear and non-linear contributions through chemical yields.

\subsubsection{Quantifying the difference of age-{[X/H]} sequences}

In this section, we are concerned with the significance of separation between the in-situ and accreted sequences in the simulations - for now in the idealised case without observational noise (we will study the latter in Sec.~\ref{sec:noise_influence}).

\begin{table*}

    \input{tables/tabular_separation_r12_noise.tex}
    \label{tab:tabular_separation_r12_noise}
\end{table*}

For this purpose, we trace the distribution of abundances [X/H] for the three sequences defined by Eqs.~\ref{eq:sequence1}-\ref{eq:sequence3} in histograms across different age bins. In Fig.~\ref{fig:histograms_xh_in_age_bins_Mn}, we show the histograms for the different sequences in age bins of $0.5\,\mathrm{Gyr}$ above $8.5\,\mathrm{Gyr}$, the youngest age of stars in Sequence 2. The panels of each figure include further useful information. Following the color-scheme from Fig.~\ref{fig:three_sequences_traced}, they state the relative contribution of each sequence to the age bin in percent, followed by the median abundance as well as the difference to the $16^\mathrm{th}$ and $84^\mathrm{th}$ percentile. We note firstly that for the contribution of accreted stars is increasing from $8\%$ for $8.5-9.0\,\mathrm{Gyr}$ to $78\%$ for $12.5-13.0\,\mathrm{Gyr}$. In addition to the decrease of overall [Mn/H] towards older ages, we note that the scatter of both distributions increases from the youngest stars ($\sim 0.02-0.05\,\mathrm{dex}$) to the oldest ($\sim 0.1-0.4\,\mathrm{dex}$), while the distributions remain in a Gaussian shape for the most part, with larger tails towards lower [Mn/H] only noticeable for the oldest stars ($> 12.5\,\mathrm{Gyr}$).

    }
    \label{fig:age_sigma_vs_r}
\end{figure}

To determine the significance of separation, we are inspired by the previous study by \citet{Lindegren2013}, who computed a separation significance $r$ based on the differences of mean abundances weighted by the combined standard deviation of abundances. Having convinced ourselves that the distributions are Gaussian in the previous section, we now expand their formulation by adding observational Gaussian noise as another additive to the weights and thus arrive at the formulation
\begin{equation} \label{eq:r_value}
r_{12} (\sigma_{obs}) = \frac{|\mu_1 - \mu_2|}{\sqrt{\sigma_1^2 + \sigma_2^2 + 2\cdot \sigma_{obs}^2}} ~ \xrightarrow[\text{for Sim.}]{\sigma_\text{obs}\,=\,0} ~ r_{12} = \frac{|\mu_1 - \mu_2|}{\sqrt{\sigma_1^2 + \sigma_2^2}}
\end{equation}

Assuming no observational noise, we calculate $r_{12}$ based only on the means and standard deviations for the age bins and elements {[X/H]} listed in Tab.~\ref{tab:tabular_separation_r12} for the sequences defined in Eqs.~\ref{eq:sequence1}-Eqs.~\ref{eq:sequence3}. For completeness, we also list the properties of Sequence 3, when more than 100 particles are present.

Table~\ref{tab:tabular_separation_r12} shows that the most significant separations $r_{12} > 10$ in the age-[X/H] space are expected among the youngest accreted stars. The separation significance decreases in order \input{tex_text/r12_sorted.tex}.

\textbf{Key Takeaway:} The intrinsic scatter in {[X/H]} for both in-situ and accreted sequences is larger ($\sim 0.1-0.4\,\mathrm{dex}$) for older stars ($> 12\,\mathrm{Gyr}$) as a result of larger change in this logarithmic scale when compared to stars born at the younger age of $8.5-11.0\,\mathrm{Gyr}$ ($\sim 0.02-0.05\,\mathrm{dex}$). This would make the younger accreted stars a better candidate to trace the chemical enrichment history and infer progenitor masses than old stars. While most elements, with the exception of the less suitable Ba, showed a similarly large separation significance, the odd-Z elements P and Al would be slightly more preferable than the iron-peak and alpha-process elements, which all outperform the lightest simulated elements C, N, O, and Ne.

\subsubsection{A more realistic picture: The influence of observational noise on age-{[X/H]} sequence} \label{sec:noise_influence}

Having determined the most suitable plots for identifying accreted populations in simulations, we now consider this problem from a more realistic perspective and quantitatively determine how much noise we could allow for both abundance and age estimates to still be able to separate the sequences.

To get an intuition for the influence of measurement noise on the separation significance of abundances, we test different ranges of abundance uncertainties of $\sigma_\mathrm{obs}$ as input for Eq.~\ref{eq:r_value}. The resulting values are visualised in Fig.~\ref{fig:r12_for_sigmaobs} and representative values listed in Tab.~\ref{tab:tabular_separation_r12_noise}, which also includes median uncertainties of the measurements for GALAH DR3 \citep{Buder2021}, ranging from $\sigma_\mathrm{GALAH} = 0.06$ for [Si/H] to $\sigma_\mathrm{GALAH} = 0.13$ for [O/H] and [V/H].

When comparing the figures of simulated noiseless age-[Fe/H] relation of the Milky Way analogue in Fig.~\ref{fig:nihao_with_scatter}a with the noisy but actually observed age-[Fe/H] relation of the Milky Way within the GALAH footprint of Fig.~\ref{fig:nihao_with_scatter}e, it becomes clear that the driving factor behind the uncertainty in this plane is actually the age uncertainties of the data. We expect the sequences will be significantly more difficult to distinguish in older stars with corresponding larger uncertainties. To get a better intuition, at which age uncertainties we gain or loose more diagnostic power, we are performing a simple experiment. Assume that we know that our best chances to distinguish the sequences is to look at the youngest accreted stars, that is, those within our data set closest to $8.5\,\mathrm{Gyr}$. Using the smallest reasonable age bin ($8.5-9\,\mathrm{Gyr}$), we estimate a reasonable separation of Sequence 2 to 1 by estimating the mean and standard deviation of the sequence and adding a reasonable observational noise of $\sigma_\mathrm{obs} = 0.05\,\mathrm{dex}$ to it. This allows us to discern Sequence 1 from 2 with a rather simple cut of stars being above or below $\mu_2 + 3 \sqrt{\sigma_2^2 + \sigma_\mathrm{obs}^2}$, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:age_sigma_vs_r}a for $\mathrm{[Fe/H]} \lessgtr -0.49$. Using this abundance limit as the boundary, we can then test the distributions of Sequence 1 and 2 for increasingly large age bins of $0.5..(0.5)..4.0\,\mathrm{Gyr}$, as visualised with the selection boxes in Fig.~\ref{fig:age_sigma_vs_r}a. Performing this experiment for the various elements, we reach the distributions of $r_{12}$ in Figs.~\ref{fig:age_sigma_vs_r}a and \ref{fig:age_sigma_vs_r}b with increasing age bins size (which we equate with twice the age uncertainty).

Because we are working within the age range of $8.5-12.5\,\mathrm{Gyr}$, this means that an age bin of $2\,\mathrm{Gyr}$ would be equivalent to an age uncertainty of just over 20\%. We can see from the plot that we require an uncertainty of less than 20\% to achieve the highest separation significance $r$-value.

While being an insightful gedankenexperiment, our tests on the influence of abundance and age uncertainties, however, neglect an important fact. That is, that both uncertainties are present at the same time in observations in complex ways and a selection like ours with prior knowledge of the sequence positions is not possible for the Milky Way. Guided by our previous results on abundance and age uncertainties, and with the actual uncertainties of GALAH DR3 in mind, we have added both noises to the properties of the simulated galaxy and replicated the age-[Fe/H] in Fig.~\ref{fig:nihao_with_scatter}. This idea was also neatly implemented by \citet[][see their Fig.~12]{Renaud2021} to create more realistic noisy data for the \textsc{VINTERGATAN} simulations. Our figure shows the extremes of no noise on the left (Fig.~\ref{fig:nihao_with_scatter}a) and the actual observed Milky Way age-[Fe/H] relation in the Solar neighbourhood (Fig.~\ref{fig:nihao_with_scatter}e), with different realisations of noise in panel b (10\% age uncertainty, $0.025\,\mathrm{dex}$ noise on [Fe/H]), panel c (15\% for age, $0.05\,\mathrm{dex}$ for [Fe/H]), and panel d (30\% for age, $0.075\,\mathrm{dex}$ for [Fe/H].

\section{Discussion} \label{sec:discussion}

\SB{The initial motivation of this research was to create a variety of abundance planes and compare them using both the simulated and observed data to determine the best abundance-abundance plots for identifying substructure that could be representative of an accreted population of stars. Upon doing so, and observing very little distinct substructure in the simulated plots, these methods were deemed insufficient to confidently report any results.}

\SB{Due to the lack of potential observational uncertainties in the simulations, we expected to find significantly clearer substructure and distinct populations than had already been identified in observations \citep{Buder2022}. The fact that this wasn’t the case indicated a potential underlying problem in the theory behind this undertaking.}

\SB{Beyond a lack of observational errors, one of the key advantages of the simulations is that we know the exact history of formation and accretion  of the simulated galaxy. Unfortunately, we do not yet have the same level of certainty surrounding our own Galaxy’s evolution. We know that the simulated Milky Way analogue experienced a merger event that occurred $5\,\mathrm{Gyr}$ after formation, when a galaxy around $10^9 M_{\odot}$ merged with an in situ galaxy of around $10^{10} M_{\odot}$, values that have been estimated to the order of magnitude by multiplying the number of star particles with their average stellar mass for each sequence of the simulation. Although we do not know the exact sizes or times of accretion events in the Milky Way, the GSE is estimated to be between $10^{8.7}$ and $10^{9.85}\,M_{\odot}$ \citep{Helmi2018,Naidu2020}, which highlights a possible discrepancy between the simulations and the observations.}

\SB{The lack of reportable findings from comparing abundance-abundance planes led to a shift in focus. As discussed in Sec. \ref{sec:intro}, one of the key advantages to chemical tagging is the unchanging nature of stellar chemistry over time. This means that a star’s current chemical make-up is indicative of the time and place that it was born. Therefore plotting elemental abundance over time was hypothesised as a good indicator of accretion, as populations of different chemistry should emerge as the galaxy evolves. This was plotted and analysed in Section \ref{sec:Age-abundance}. We see three clear populations emerge in the simulations, highlighted in Fig \ref{fig:NaFe_MgMn_selection_Age_FeH_dissection}.}

\SB{Again, it is important to note that the simulated galaxy may have different characteristics to our own Galaxy. As discussed, there are two clear streams that have been attributed as accreted and in situ, based on the assumption that the accreted stars would have been born in a smaller galaxy with less massive stars and therefore lower element abundances. This clarity occurs because we know the sizes of the two galaxies that merged. Depending on the size of the real merger in the Milky Way, there could be significantly more overlap between the accreted and in situ populations if the merger was more massive. Even within the simulated data, we see significant overlap in the kinematic and chemical characteristics of the three separate streams, which is clear in Fig \ref{fig:NaFe_MgMn_selection_Age_FeH_dissection}. This indicates that within the simulated data, and potentially the real Milky Way, there may be significant uncertainty in distinguishing between the accreted and in situ populations, using the dynamic or chemical information.}

\SB{However, there is potential in using the simulations to ‘clean up’ the observational data. We see large amounts of scatter in the observations. However, there is a hint of an overdensity toward the bottom right of the plot, which could be indicative of an accreted population. Applying the quality cute provided with the GALAH data had little effect on the clarity of this overdensity, but with better quality cuts, more time and expertise- and better data- this ‘hint’ could start looking more like what is shown in the observations.}

\SB{Similar research should be performed with other cosmological simulations, preferably with varied chemistry and formation histories. This would enable researchers to observe exactly how different variables in the simulation affect outcomes. More importantly, the research was limited by the uncertainties present in the observations, especially in the ages. If the error margins corresponding to age measurements can be drastically reduced, we have found that plotting element abundance over age holds significant potential for the identification of accreted stars.}

\SB{Putting our work into greater context of extragalactic work \citep[e.g.][]{Pinna2019, Pinna2019b, Martig2021} and ongoing observational projects such as the large MUSE program GECKOS \citep{GECKOS2023}.}

Any important comparisons to the results from \citet{Buck2023} that we should make?

}

\SB{The aim of this paper was to determine the best diagnostic plots for identifying accreted stars in the Milky Way, through comparison of a cosmological simulation from the NIHAO suite and data from the GALAH survey. The major take-away points from this undertaking were:
\begin{itemize}
\item While the assessment of chemical abundance planes of the Milky Way analogue for the whole galaxy is actually overshadowing the minor contribution of accretion, we confirmed the potential of age-abundance and abundance-abundance plots for smaller regions, both in similar footprint as current Milky Way observations (Fig.~\ref{fig:low_alpha_halo}) as well as extragalactic observations (Fig.~\ref{fig:accretion_rate}). 
\item We determined that although there were three clear population streams apparent in the simulated data, significant overlap appeared when these were plotted in terms of dynamical and chemical properties (Fig.~\ref{fig:three_sequences_traced}).
\item Plotting elemental abundances against age however, proved fruitful, with very distinct streams representing accreted and in situ populations appearing in the simulation data. These clear streams were not as clear in the observation-based plots , as a result of massive uncertainties that come with the probabilistic nature of estimating stellar ages through isochrone fitting.
\item Elemental abundances as relative to H (rather than Fe) produced more significant separations between in-situ and accreted sequences as a function of stellar age.
\item Our tests of adding noise to simulated data suggest, that we will be able to more easily tell apart accreted structures, once we undergo a critical age uncertainty of 20\% and can measure elemental abundances [X/H] of accreted structures as good as $\sigma_\text{obs} \sim 0.40\,\mathrm{dex}$.
\end{itemize}
}

\SB{Absence of features does not mean that they are not present! We initially thought that the chemical abundance planes of the simulation possessed too much intrinsic overlap to be useful to this particular endeavour. But that was based on diagnostic plots for the whole galaxy! Sec.~\ref{sec:location}}


\SB{We conclude that this study holds exciting prospects for the future of our understanding of accretion in the Milky Way. As our observational data continues to improve, we will increase our confidence in recognising accreted stars in our own Galaxy.}

\SB{NOTE TO OURSELVES: We see this interesting prediction of high [Ba/Fe] for the youngest accreted stars in both observations and simulations! That is quite remarkable and can maybe help us to study the influence of AGB stars in the metal-poor regime?!}

\SB{Future Analysis:
\begin{itemize}
\item Age and abundance precision for different 25ish NIHAO sims
\item Age and abundance precision for different yields
\end{itemize}
}

\SB{Selection does not affect the age-metallicity relations, but definitely the [Al/Fe] vs. [Mg/Mn] plane! Just because don't something in one the planes does not mean it's not there!}


\SB{These observations of stellar and gaseous components complement the advancements from the modelling perspective, where recent studies have found significant impacts of massive mergers on the cold gas metallicity gradients \citep{Buck2023}. \citet{Buck2023} analyse the impact of mergers on the abundance gradients for example in the age-metallicity relation.}

\SB{\textsc{VINTERGATAN} simulations by \citep{Agertz2021} and \citep{Renaud2021, Renaud2021b}}

\SB{especially \textsc{VINTERGATAN} II \citep{Renaud2021} is focused on the accreted stars. Their accreted stars do, when inspecting their Fig.~4, appear to have higher [$\upalpha$/Fe] compared to the in-situ stars, a behaviour that we do not find in our Milky Way analogue (Fig.~\ref{fig:three_sequences_traced}i) or the Milky Way itself. That said, we believe that in this case the definition of \textit{accreted} may vary slightly, as in them using stars born outside, whereas we refer to a whole sequence of stars born outside - an impression based on the comparison of their age-[Fe/H] relation without a secondary sequence and our Milky Way analogue with a clear secondary sequence.}

\SB{No clear indication of stars formed in the outer disk as in \citet[][see their Fig.~8]{Renaud2021b}}

\SB{\citep{Renaud2022}: "Starbursts, i.e. episodes of fast star formation, are connected with the onset of tidal compression, itself induced by mergers. However, this compression becomes strong enough to trigger starbursts only after the formation of the galactic disc."}

\section{Abundance trends of simulations that are not covered by GALAH observations} \label{sec:appendix_other_abundances}

In this section, we append abundance-abundance figures (Fig.~\ref{fig:appendix_feh_xfe_nneps}) and age-abundance figures (Fig.~\ref{fig:appendix_xfe_xh_nx}) that were not shown in the main manuscript, mainly because the shown elements were either not measured in the GALAH Survey and would thus not provide further insight for the analyses of observations.
