%Context: 
Galactic accretion, the process wherein smaller galaxies merge with the Milky Way, has been posited as a plausible explanation for several properties of the present-day Galaxy, including old stars on dynamically hot orbits and the bimodality of chemical composition within the stellar disk. Testing this hypothesis has so far been hindered by our ability to find and characterise accreted stars and their now-dispersed host galaxies. We will use a cosmological zoom-in simulation from the NIHAO suite, which now also traces the chemical composition of selected elements, to explore a simulated Milky Way analogue. Comparing the noise-free simulations to noisy and incomplete observations of our Milky Way, provided by the spectroscopic stellar GALAH survey, we assess several diagnostic plots in chemical and age-abundance space to identify accreted stars. We confirm the strength of chemical planes such as [Al/Fe] vs [Mg/Mn], but find a stronger potential for separating accretion events in the age-abundance plane. We therefore analyse the necessary quality of observations to capitalise on this premise and find a significant separation of accreted and in-situ sequences at 68\% confidence for 0.2 dex and 15\% abundance and age uncertainties, respectively. Once this uncertainty threshold is overcome, we will be able to better identify and characterise accretion in the Milky Way—confirming the need for more precise ages and abundances, as will be delivered by the second phase of the GALAH survey.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

The history of the Milky Way is a puzzle that has taunted astronomers for decades. The long lifetimes and rather conserved chemical composition of stars makes them key pieces in this puzzle, allowing us to use their star light as fossil record to gain insights into the historical processes that have led to our Galaxy as we know it today \citep{FreemanBlandHawthorn2002}. The advent of new large-scale stellar surveys, providing a wealth of information including measurements of elemental abundances\footnote{We define elemental abundances, such as [Fe/H], [Mg/Fe], and [Mg/Mn] as logarithmic ratios of two elemental number densities $N_\text{X}$ and $N_\text{Y}$ compared to the Sun, that is, $\left[\text{X/Y}\right]=\log_{10}\left(\frac{N_\text{X}}{N_\text{Y}}\right) -\log_{10}\left(\frac{N_\text{X}}{N_\text{Y}}\right)_\odot$.} for millions of stars, has enabled insights into the long and complex history of our Galaxy that have been previously unattainable \citep{Jofre2019}. Astrometric information for more than 1.5 billion stars from the \Gaia satellite \citep{Brown2016,Brown2018,Brown2021} has given us a new understanding of the structure of our Galaxy, while spectroscopic surveys like the Galactic Archaeology with HERMES (GALAH) Survey \citep{daSilva2015} and the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment \citep[APOGEE,][]{Majewski2016} are complementing this vision with chemical fingerprints for millions of stars. Most notably, these surveys have led to the confirmation of a major accretion event around 8-10 billions years ago by \citet{Belokurov2018} and \citet{Helmi2018}. While this major merger of the \Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE) and the early Milky Way could explain the bimodality of stars in the Milky Ways disk, the causality is yet to be established beyond doubt. Our best avenue is to quantify the chemical and dynamical properties of accreted stars to answer outstanding questions like how much gas the GSE merger brought in to explain the significantly different chemistry of young versus old disk stars.

From our vantage point within the disk-dominated region of the Milky Way, it is difficult to identify the relatively low number of accreted stars. Intensive research has tested a variety of ways to find such stars - an extensive list of which is presented by \citet{Buder2022}. A first impulse was given by the series of papers by \citet{Nissen2010, Nissen2011, Nissen2014} and \citet{Schuster2012} that analysed the chemistry of stars in the kinematic halo of the Milky Way. They identified a population within the Galactic halo that showed significantly lower enhancements across a number of elements, hinting to an extra-Galactic origin. Starting from dynamic arguments, \citet{Belokurov2018} and \citet{Helmi2018} rediscovered this population as stars with outstanding eccentric and radial orbits and proved its significance via dynamical simulations and chemical evolution arguments. Peaking further into the halo, \citet{Naidu2020} then showed that the halo is entirely compromised of substructure, including accreted stars. Studies of extragalactic sources can now also spatially resolve these source broadly and use age-metallicity relations to identify accreted stars \citep{Martig2021}, with tens of edge-on galaxies being observed by the MUSE integral field spectrograph through large programs like GECKOS \citep{GECKOS2023}. Such analyses are however limited by the fact that spatial and dynamical selections are less robust in a spatially and dynamically evolving galaxy over billions of years.

The key advantage of chemical tagging, when compared to dynamical tagging via velocities or energies, is that the composition of heavy elements, once locked in the atmosphere of a star, is expected to be much more conserved in a dynamically evolving galaxy. Building upon this premise, \citet{Hawkins2015}, \citet{Das2020} and \citet{Buder2022} assessed a number of potential abundance combinations for chemically tagging accreted stars. Among the many elements in the periodic table, they identified especially Na, Al, and Cu as exceptionally useful, if they can be measured. Using these elements together with the purer tracers of core-collapse supernovae (CC-SN), like Mg, and supernovae type Ia (SNIa), like Mn, they found the abundance planes of [Na/Fe] vs. [Mg/Mn] and [Al/Fe] vs. [Mg/Mn] to reveal accreted stars in rather isolated loci.

Ages and abundances are, however, not directly observable and difficult to obtain from stellar spectra and any age-inference tool. Significant progress has been made in terms of the number and quality of observations, but we are still limited by our ability to observe a significant number of accreted stars with accurate and precise ages and abundances. While the GALAH survey can for example measure Na abundances, it is particularly difficult to measure Al abundances from its spectra. The observed stellar ages of GALAH DR3 are even more uncertain - with an average age uncertainty of $33\pm20\%$. Cosmological simulations, such as those used in this study, carry no age uncertainties and the particular simulation \citep{Buck2021} we use here, introduced in Sec.~\ref{sec:sim_data}, now also includes chemical abundance information. This provides an exceptional data set for exploring both the theoretically expected impact of massive mergers on the chemical evolution of Milky Way-like galaxies \citep{Buck2023} as well as our observational diagnostic tools, without uncertainty margins to consider.

The aim of this project is to assess diagnostic tools for identifying accreted structures from observations in the Milky Way by comparing them with theoretical predictions from cosmological simulations. This assessment will be based on our ability to observe and quantify clear patterns and trends. In addition to testing chemical tagging, that is, relying only on abundances, we also test the use of age-abundance planes and make predictions on the necessary uncertainties for the diagnostic properties when assuming the Milky Way analogue as ground truth.

The paper is structured as follows: Sec.~\ref{sec:data} describes the data of NIHAO simulations and GALAH observations. Sec ~\ref{sec:comparison} performs an initial comparison of diagnostic plots, using different abundance planes. Sec ~\ref{sec:Age-abundance} instead considers how stellar abundance changes over time, and quantifies the results. Sec ~\ref{sec:discussion} discusses the findings and their implications.

\section{Data: Chemical abundances from observations and simulations} \label{sec:data}

\subsection{Observational data from the GALAH Survey}\label{sec:obs_data}

Observations are provided through the GALactic Archaeology with HERMES (GALAH) survey. For our study, we use the abundance measurements of 588,571 stars from the third data release (DR3) of the GALAH Survey \citep{Buder2021}. The main program of the survey targets nearby stars via their visual magnitudes (typically $9 < V < 12$ and $12 < V < 14$) while neglecting the Galactic plane ($\vert b \vert > 10\,\mathrm{deg}$). However, the data release also includes auxiliary programs of the K2 and TESS footprints \citep{Sharma2018, Sharma2019} as well as open and globular clusters \cite[for more details see][]{Buder2021}. Stars were targeted with the 2dF fibre optics positioner system at the Anglo-Australian Telescope \citep{Heijmans2012, Farrell2014} and the light of up to 400 stars was simultaneously fed into the High Efficiency and Resolution Multi-Element Spectrograph \citep[HERMES,][]{Barden2010, Sheinis2015}. HERMES delivers high-resolution ($R \sim 28,000$) spectra in four wavelength bands across the optical range which were reduced with the pipeline by \citep{Kos2017}.

Stellar parameters ($T_\text{eff}$, $\log g$, [Fe/H], $v_\text{mic}$, $v_\text{broad}$, and $v_\text{rad}$) and abundances for up to 31\footnote{C, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, K, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Rb, Sr, Y, Zr, Mo, Ru, La, Ce, Nd, Sm, and Eu} different elements across multiple nucleosynthesis channels are estimated using a modified version of the spectrum synthesis code Spectroscopy Made Easy \citep[\textsc{sme}][]{Valenti1996, Piskunov2017} and 1D \textsc{marcs} model atmospheres \citep{Gustafsson2008}. Eleven elements are computed in non-LTE \citep{Amarsi2020}, the others in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE), and additional constraints on the surface gravities are incorporated through inferred distances by \citet{BailerJones2021} and their limit on absolute magnitudes and luminosities.

In addition to the chemical information, we use the crossmatches of stars with value-added-catalog for stellar ages. The latter incorporates photometric and astrometric information from \Gaia eDR3 \citep{Lindegren2021a} and 2MASS \citep{Skrutskie2006} to estimate isochrone ages with the BSTEP code \citep{Sharma2018}.

We apply the following general quality and selection cuts to the data, firstly $\texttt{flag\_repeat} = 0$ to get one measurement per star, and secondly $\texttt{flag\_sp} = 0$, $\texttt{flag\_fe\_h} = 0$, $\texttt{flag\_Mg\_fe} = 0$, and $\texttt{snr\_c2\_iraf} > 25$ to get the most reliable stellar parameters while maintaining a sufficient amount of stars. Whenever we use additional elemental abundances of an element X, we also enforce $\texttt{flag\_X\_fe} = 0$.

\subsection{Theoretical predictions from a NIHAO Zoom-in simulation}\label{sec:sim_data}

The model perspective on accretion is provided through a cosmological zoom-in simulation of a Milky Way analogue (\texttt{g8.26e11}) from the \textit{Numerical Investigation of a Hundred Astronomical Objects} \citep[NIHAO,][]{Wang2015}. The total mass of $8.26 \cdot 10^{11}\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$ contains $4 \cdot 10^{10}\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$ stellar mass with a stellar mass resolution of $1.06 \cdot 10^{5}\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$ \citep{Buck2021}.

Simulations were carried out with the smoothed particle hydrodynamics code \texttt{Gasoline2} \citep{Wadsley2017} starting from the cosmological parameters from \citet{Planck2014} with initial conditions and energetic feedback descriptions from the NIHAO project \citep{Wang2015}. Zoom-in simulations were then performed as described in detail by \citet{Buck2021} with star formation following \citet{Stinson2006} and feedback following \citet{Stinson2013}.

Because computational resource still limits the mass resolution of simulations, we are relying on tracer particles that represent simple stellar populations (SSPs) with the same age, overall metallicity and discrete initial mass function (IMF). \citet{Buck2021} have implemented the flexible chemical evolution code \textsc{chempy} \citep{Rybizki2017} to calculate the chemical yields for the SSPs. In particular, we use the alternative (\texttt{alt}) setup of \textsc{chempy} that assumes a \citet{Chabrier2003} IMF with high-mass slope of $\alpha_\text{IMF} = -2.3$ over a mass range of $0.1-100\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$ for SSPs across a metallicity range of $Z/Z_\odot \in [10^{-5},2]$. The code calculates the contribution from asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars, CC-SN across a mass range of $8-40\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$, and SNIa with a an exponential function with exponent $-1.12$, a delay time of $40\,\mathrm{Myr}$, and a normalization of the SNI rate of -2.9. For each of these nucleosynthetic channels, yields from the following studies are used: \citet{Limongi2018} for CC-SN, \citet{Seitenzahl2013} for SNIa, and \citet{Karakas2016} for AGB stars.

To achieve a roughly similar selection as the observational data, while maintaining enough star particles, we limit the simulated data set to star particles within a torus at $8.2\,\mathrm{kpc}$ galactocentric radius with a $4.2\,\mathrm{kpc}$ tube radius (corresponding to the 95th distance percentile of the GALAH sample) and neglect star particles within $\vert b \vert < 10\,mathrm{deg}$.

The simulation traces the elemental abundances of H, He, C, N, O, Ne, Mg, Al, Si, P, S, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, and Ba. Of these, ten correspond with the GALAH data and allow us to compare diagnostic plots possible with abundances of C, O, Mg, Al, Si, V, Cr, Mn, Co and Ba.

\section{Diagnostic plots: Observation vs. Simulation}
\label{sec:comparison}

In Sec.~\ref{sec:intro}, we have reviewed several observation-based plots that have been used to identify accreted stars in the Milky Way. In this section, we are now interested in the question if the simulated Milky Way analogue shows similar signatures when using these diagnostic plots\footnote{\SB{Come back to this if we figure out that we actually do have to limit the simulation space to the Solar neighborhood - which we have not done yet!}}.

\subsection{Location matters} \label{sec:location}

    \label{fig:AlFe_MgMn_selection_Age_FeH_dissection_sim}
\end{figure*}

\subsection{Abundance trends: [Fe/H] vs. [X/Fe]} \label{sec:feh_xfe}

We begin our comparison by plotting the elemental abundances of then elements X that overlap between GALAH observations and NIHAO simulations. Fig.~\ref{fig:FeH_XFe} shows the elemental abundances [X/Fe] as a function of iron abundance [Fe/H]. To first order we see an agreement of general trends for most elements, that is, elements that are produced by CC-SN like O, Mg, and Si are showing a high plateau for low [Fe/H] and a decrease towards higher iron abundances. The iron-peak elements Cr as well as Mn and Co show increasing abundances from low values at low [Fe/H] towards solar values at solar [Fe/H]. A similar agreement can be found for V and Co when neglecting the high [X/Fe] stars as recommended by \citet{Buder2021}. For Ba, we also large enhancements at solar [Fe/H] and another sequence with high [Ba/Fe] at iron abundances around -1.

\begin{figure*}
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/Overview_FeH_XFe_Obs_Sim.png}
    \caption{
    \textbf{Distribution of elemental abundances [X/Fe] versus [Fe/H] for the ten elements overlapping between GALAH and NIHAO.} 
    \textbf{First and third rows} show observed data from GALAH and \textbf{second and fourth rows} show the simulated data for the same abundance ratios. Color maps are showing the logarithmic density distributions with brightest colors indicating highest densities. For better visibility, plot ranges are adjusted to the data rather than to be equal among each panel. Dashed lines indicate Solar values.}
    \label{fig:FeH_XFe}
\end{figure*}

Upon quantitative inspection, however, we see significant differences between the chemical evolution sequences, despite showing most data points around the solar iron abundances $\mathrm{[Fe/H]} \sim 0$, most notably the significant difference in actual abundance values. To understand this difference, we first need to remind ourselves that the observational data is limited by the ability to measure abundances (note the missing abundances of [C/Fe] for low metallicities due to detection limits) and includes measurement noise, while the theoretical data does not necessarily have to reproduce the formation scenario of the Milky Way. Trying to identify key features that agree between observation and simulation, we find two sequences in both observation and simulation. In the observations we find a sequence of solar (or low) [Mg/Fe] and an enhanced one at $\mathrm{[Mg/Fe] \sim 0.3}$. \SB{Tobias: Where is the high-alpha sequence in the simulation data?}

Looking at the metal-poor regime below $\mathrm{[Fe/H]} < -0.5$, [C/Fe] shows a significant separation, this cannot be followed up in the incomplete observational data. [Ba/Fe], however, shows significantly separated sequences in both observations and simulations.

\textbf{Key Takeaway:} While simple abundance-metallicity plots do not reveal accreted structures and are thus not robust method of identifying accreted stars, both C and Ba abundances show the potential to identify different abundance sequences.

\subsection{Abundance-abundance plots: [Al/Fe] vs. [Mg/Mn]} \label{sec:alfe_mgmn}

The inscrutable results of Fig.~\ref{fig:low_alpha_halo} led to abundance vs metallicity plots being deemed unusable for identifying accreted stars. We turn then to abundance-abundance plots of [Al/Fe] vs. [Mg/Mn]. These plots combine the enrichment channels of CC-SN vs. SNIa, that is [Mg/Mn], and the enrichment of Al with more complex metallicity-dependent enrichment pathways \citep{Hawkins2015, Das2020, Kobayashi2020}. The enhancements of these elements should differ significantly when comparing in-situ stars born in the early Milky Way with the less massive system that it accreted because of the expected lower star formation intensity (and thus iron abundance) and occurrence of CC-SN in the latter. 

In Fig.~\ref{fig:low_alpha_halo}, we contrast the simulations with the observations, starting with the simulations (top) and observations (bottom) on the same axes in the left panels. The disagreement between both figures is striking and suggests that either the chemical enrichment evolution of the simulation is significantly different from the Milky Way or the simulation does not reproduce these nuances in the chemical enrichment of different pathways.


 Looking first at the observations, there are clear overdensities visible in both plots, as expected. Both [Na/Fe] and [Al/Fe] plots show the overdensity for the thin/low-alpha disk at the expected solar abundances at (0,0). The high-alpha disk is seen in an overdensity at around (0.4,0.5). More importantly, although not clear for [Al/Fe] with the GALAH data in this report, accreted stars are visible in the [Na/Fe] plot at around (-0.4,0.4). These observations concur with Das et al (2020) and Horta et al (2020), which both used APOGEE data and the [Al/Fe] ratio instead. \par 
In the simulations, there is very significant zeropoint shift from the observations, where the only clear overdensity of the thin disk is at (-0.23, -0.55) instead of the expected (0,0). The overall shape and structural composition is also massively different from the plots created with GALAH data and there is no clear structure that one could confidently assert is accreted or in-situ. The significant discrepancy between the observations and simulations indicates an underlying problem in the methodology of this research. This could be either because chemical abundance plots are generally unreliable for diagnosing accreted stars, or because of inaccurate chemical enrichment in the simulation. \par 
\textbf{Key Takeaway:} Abundance-abundance plots are not reliable, even when using elements we expect to clearly show accretion (ie. alpha elements). What is clear in the observations is not so clear in the simulations.
%The fact that this was not the case may indicate different chemical evolution in the simulation and the actual Milky Way. This could be either because they are truly inherently different or the result of inaccurate chemical enrichment in the simulation. 


% We then plot the ratio of a light odd-z element (Na and Al) against alpha element Mg over Mn, shown in Fig.~3. The ratio of [Mg/Mn] represents the ratio of SNII and SNIa dominated elements respectively. Looking first at the observations, there are clear overdensities visible in both plots.  Both [Na/Fe] and [Al/Fe] plots show the overdensity for the thin/low-alpha disk at the expected solar abundances at (0,0). The high-alpha disk is seen in an overdensity at around (0.4,0.5). More importantly, although not clear for [Al/Fe] with the GALAH data in this report, accreted stars are visible in the [Na/Fe] plot at around (-0.4,0.4). These observations concur with \citet{Das2020} and \citet{Horta2020}, which both used APOGEE data and the [Al/Fe] ratio instead. \par 
% In the simulations, there is very significant zeropoint shift from the observations, where the only clear overdensity of the thin disk is at (-0.23, -0.55) instead of the expected (0,0). The overall shape and structural composition is also massively different from the plots created with GALAH data. The simulations contain zero noise, and it was expected that this would clarify the results seen in the observational data. The fact that this was not the case may indicate different chemical evolution in the simulation and the actual Milky Way. This could be either because they are truly inherently different or the result of inaccurate chemical enrichment in the simulation. \par




% \begin{itemize}
%     \item As suggested by \citet{Hawkins2015} and \citet{Das2020} based on data from the APOGEE survey as well as \citet{Buder2022} based on data from the GALAH survey, we plot the ratio of a light odd-Z element (Na and Al) as well as the ratio of SNII and SNIa dominated elements (Mg and Mn, respectively) in Fig.~\ref{fig:AlFe_MgMn_selection_Age_FeH_dissection_sim}.
%     \item Describe observations: overdensities for thin/low-alpha disk around (0,0), thick/high-alpha disk at (0.4,0.5) and accreted stars around (-0.4,0.4), refer to \citet{Das2020, Horta2021}. Not so clear for [Al/Fe] with GALAH, but clearer when using [Na/Fe] \citep{Buder2022}. \SB{We could use APOGEE DR17 for a better/clearer comparison.}
%     \item Describe simulations: Zeropoint shift, that is the location of the thin disk around (-0.23,-0.55) instead (0,0). But also overall structure is significantly different: No noise, but also no clear substructure!
%     \item Interpretation: different chemical evolution in simulation and Milky Way (either because truly different or because chemical enrichment in simulation not accurate).

\section{A new angle: age-abundance-distributions}\label{sec:Age-abundance}

Fortunately, chemistry is not the only conserved property of stars. We therefore turn to stellar ages and assess age-abundance trends in the data. Observations still suffer from incredibly large uncertainties on the order of $30-50\%$ for most stars, so examining simulation plots removes this barrier and allow us to determine chemical enrichment as a function of age. We note here that age is based on the age of the simulated universe being 14.14 Gyr \citep{Buck2021}. Although the observational plots showed incomprehensible results, there is very clear substructure in the simulated age-abundance plots, with two distinct streams for the two populations (in-situ and accreted). The comparison of observed and simulated age-abundance plots is shown in Figs \ref{fig:BaFetime} and \ref{fig:BaHtime}. The top stream in the plots is likely representative of the in-situ population, as we know that accreted populations tend to join the Milky Way from smaller galaxies with less massive stars. This means that the stars are less metal-heavy and explains the lower stream of accreted stars that can be observed in the simulation data. \par 

The stark difference in clarity of results between the uncertainty-free simulation data and the high-uncertainty GALAH data highlights the importance of reducing observation noise, and provides clear motivation for further investigation into these plots as diagnostic tools. Similar plots have been used already with GALAH data to identify accreted substructure in galaxies other than the Milky Way \citep{Martig2021}.\par 
\textbf{Key Takeaway:} Age is a conserved characteristic of stars that shows distinct populations when plotted against chemical abundance.
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item Chemistry is not the only conserved property of stars.
%     \item We therefore turn to stellar ages and assess age-abundance trends in the simulations. This is an especially informative exercise, as stellar ages are currently still suffering from low precisions on the order of 30-50\% for most stars. Our simulation, however, traces the formation age \texttt{tform} as a perfect value and we can infer stellar ages by subtracting \texttt{tform} from the age of the universe, which is $14.14\,\mathrm{Gyr}$ in the simulation.
%     \item Such plots have been used in observed data of other galaxies to identify accreted stars \citep{Martig2021}.

\subsection{The importance of notation: [X/Fe] or [X/H]}
Several existing studies have suggested using elemental abundances reported as a function of Hydrogen number density (\citet{Fuhrmann2017}, \citet{Feuillet2021}). We produced the age-abundance plots using a range of chemical abundances, and confirmed this finding— that [X/H] produced the most clarified plots. This is highlighted in Figures \ref{fig:BaFetime} and \ref{fig:BaHtime} where we compare age plots of [X/Fe] and [X/H], and see much more clearly separated stellar populations in the H plot. Fe is being simultaneously enriched along with the element we are comparing it to (Ba is used here as an arbitrary example), which results in less clarity in the overall plot. As Hydrogen was formed in the Big Bang nucleosynthesis, it is not enhanced or affected by time in the same way that metals like Fe are. Having determined the most suitable plot for identifying accreted populations via the simulations, it is now important to consider the problem from a realistic perspective, and quantitatively determine how much noise we could allow for both abundance and age estimates to still be able to separate the sequences. \par 

\SB{Note interesting facts in Fig.~\ref{fig:Fe_H_lin_time}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Clear separation in sequences
    \item Linear increase of accreted stars.
    \item Onset of chemical scatter for in-situ stars of simulation coincides with end of star formation in accreted sequence (compare with Lucy's work!)
    \item Gap in stars also in observable space. Where are the GSE stars? 0.3 or below 0.1?
\end{itemize}
}
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item Discuss that some previous studies have suggested to use elemental abundances reported as a function of hydrogen number density \citep[see e.g.][]{Fuhrmann2017b, Feuillet2021}.
% \end{itemize}

% Fig.~\ref{fig:BaHtime} shows the elemental ratio of [Ba/Fe] over time. This same plot was created using every elemental combination available in the dataset, and it was found that the combination of [X/H] over time produced the clearest plot, as in Fig.~\ref{fig:BaHtime}. Hydrogen, being formed in the Big Bang nucleosynthesis, is not enhanced or affected by time, whereas metals like Fe are. This is why [X/H] plots are decidedly clearer than [X/Fe], as Fe is being simultaneously enriched along with Ba.

% As the abundances show clear sequences in [Ba/H] (and the other abundances), we now want to study how much noise we could allow for both abundance and age estimates, to still be able to separate the sequences.
\par\textbf{Key Takeaway:} The abundance vs age plots are clearest when the abundance is relative to H, rather than Fe or any other metal.


\subsection{Quantifying differences of age-abundance sequences} \label{sec:ageabundance}

To determine two different stellar populations as being accreted and in situ, we need to be able to quantify the difference between the two groups. This is done using separation significance $r$. This value is found using Eq.~\ref{eq:r_value}, which has been adapted from \citet{Lindegren2013}, and assumes a Gaussian distribution around a mean value $\mu$ with a standard deviation $\sigma$, for each population. This assumption is confirmed by plotting a histogram of [X/H] for the simulation between 8 and $9\,\mathrm{Gyr}$, an example of which is found in Fig.~\ref{fig:hist_labels}. The larger peak (with subscripts of 2) represents the in-situ population, and the smaller (1) is the accreted population. 

\begin{equation} \label{eq:r_value}
r = \frac{|\mu_1 - \mu_2|}{\sqrt{\sigma_1^2 + \sigma_2^2}}
\end{equation}

In the simulation the standard deviation would only incorporate the intrinsic scatter, that is, $\sigma_{1,\text{obs}} = \sigma_1$. In the observations, the observational scatter (which we assume uniform throughout the parameter space) would enter into Eq. \ref{eq:r_value} via
\begin{equation} \label{eq:scatter}
    \sigma_{1,\text{obs}} = \sqrt{\sigma_1^2+\sigma_{obs}^2},
\end{equation}
leading to a slightly adjusted version of Eq.~\ref{eq:r_value}, that is,
\begin{equation} \label{eq:r_value_observed}
r (\sigma_{obs}) = \frac{|\mu_1 - \mu_2|}{\sqrt{\sigma_1^2 + \sigma_2^2 + 2\cdot \sigma_{obs}^2}}.
\end{equation}

\begin{figure}
	\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{figures/hist_labelled.png}
    \caption{A discrete 1D histogram of Barium (used just as an example), with two distinct Gaussian distributions representative of the accreted and in situ populations. This plot has been labelled with diagramatic indicators of the values of mean ($\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$) and standard deviation ($\sigma_1$ and $\sigma_2$) which are used in this project to quantify the separation between populations.}
    \label{fig:hist_labels}
\end{figure}

To determine the positions of the sequences and subsequent separation of data, we fit a bimodal Gaussian model to the data, for each element. These values are tabulated in Table.~\ref{tab:separation_significance_two_sequences}, along with the calculated r-value.\par 

\textbf{Key Takeaway:} The data is in the form of a Gaussian model, which could be used to determine the standard deviations and means of both populations, and quantify the separation significance. 


% We then split the dataset for this particular into 2 and calculated 16th, 50th, and 84th percentiles in order to recover a more robust mean and standard deviation (and monitor our assumption of a Gaussian distribution).
% \SB{We list the values of 16th, 50th, and 84th percentiles as well as the resulting $r$ values in Tab.~\ref{tab:r_values_simulation}.}

\input{tables/separation_significance_two_sequences} % \label{tab:separation_significance_two_sequences}

\subsection{Assessing the influence of observational uncertainties}

Having identified age-abundance plots as the clearest diagnostic tool of accreted stars, and having quantified our results, we now seek to determine what uncertainty limit is acceptable in our observations. We do this two-fold. Firstly, we test how much observational scatter $\sigma_{obs}$ is allowable, while still being able to tell apart the sequences with a confidence of 68\% or 95\% (r-values of at least 1 or 2). This is plotted in Fig.~\ref{fig:r_v_obs}, and quantified in Table \ref{tab:r_values_simulation}. It is clear that all elements have a relatively similar error allowance of 0.18 for 95\% confidence and 0.38 for 68\%. Comparing these values to GALAH data used in this study finds that most measured element uncertainties, but not all, fall below our calculated threshold. \par  
We then must consider the second facet of uncertainty: the age uncertainties of the data. We expect the sequences will be significantly more difficult to distinguish in older stars with corresponding larger uncertainties. This is plotted in Fig.~\ref{fig:r_v_age}, using a subset of data within 4-5Gyr. This age subset is used as it is the range within which there is the clearest separation between the two populations in the simulated plots, shown in Figs. \ref{fig:BaFetime} and \ref{fig:BaHtime}. We see there is more deviation among elements than in Fig.~\ref{fig:r_v_obs}, but there remains a similar cut-off point where separation significance increases notably, at approximately 1Gyr. Because we are working within the age range of 4-5Gyr, this means that a 1Gyr uncertainty is equivalent to just over 20\%. We can see from the plot that we require an uncertainty of around 15\% before the r-value begins to increase, which is much lower than the age uncertainties we currently have from GALAH data. \par
\textbf{Key Takeaway:} We are able to quantify the level of uncertainty (both in element and age measurements) allowable for clear populations, and find the GALAH data has sufficient element measurements, but significantly too high age uncertainties. 



% \begin{itemize}
%     \item abundances uncertainties, entering as $\sigma_{\text{obs}}$ into Eq.~\ref{eq:r_value_observed}.
%     \item age uncertainties, making it hard to distinguish between the sequences for the oldest stars.
% \end{itemize}

% Assessing both influences in the observational data is difficult because we do not know the underlying distribution of accreted versus in-situ stars. We therefore turn to the simulations and perform two tests. Firstly, we test how much observational scatter $\sigma_{\text{obs}}$ is allowed to still tell apart the sequences with a confidence of 68 or 95\% ($r$-values of at least 1 or 2)? Secondly, we test how well we can tell the sequences apart when adding age uncertainties. In this particular case, we start from our initial subset selected for ages of $8-9\,\mathrm{Gyr}$ and ask, how would our selection change, if we cannot separate these stars from the even older ones (increasing our selection from $8-9\,\mathrm{Gyr}$ towards $8-10\,\mathrm{Gyr}$, $8-11\,\mathrm{Gyr}$, etc.)?

% We plot the results of the first test, $r (\sigma_\text{obs})$ in Fig.~\ref{fig:r_v_obs} and compare it to the average reported uncertainty from GALAH. There is very little range between elements on these plots, and it is clear that all elements require a level of noise to be below approximately 0.4 to be 68\% sure the populations are separate, and below 0.2 to be 95\% confident. Within the accessible GALAH dataset, we can access the corresponding measurement uncertainties, and find that most, but not all, measurements of chemical abundances fall below these thresholds - if they can be measured and are reported.

\begin{figure}
	\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{figures/same_axis_r_sigma.png}
    \caption{Similar to Fig.~\ref{fig:r_v_age}, this plot shows all elements on an axis of their separation significance $r$ as a function of measurement noise. There are two horizontal lines at $r=1$ and $r=2$ which show the points at which we can be 68\% and 95\% confident (respectively) that we are observing two distinct populations. It is clear that these values are quite similar for all elements.}
    \label{fig:r_v_obs}
\end{figure}

\input{tables/table_2_test} % \label{tab:uncertainties_simulation}

\begin{figure}
	\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{figures/same_axis_r_age.png}
    \caption{Separation significance $r$ against age uncertainty (in Gyr) for all elements. These plots were made using data in the time-span between 4 and 5 Gyr after formation. So a 1 Gyr uncertainty is just over 20\% uncertainty. The five elements in the right-side plot have notably higher r-values than those in the left plot. The figure clearly demonstrates the age uncertainty at which we can become quite confident that we are observing two separate populations.}
    \label{fig:r_v_age}
\end{figure}

% This further motivates our second test of the influences of ages. Fig.~\ref{fig:r_v_age} shows each element plotted with r-value against age uncertainty (in Gyr). These particular plots were created using data between \SB{4 and 5 Gyr - have to be adjusted to stellar age}, which means that a 1 Gyr uncertainty is equivalent to just over 20\%. From these plots, we can see that there is a fair amount of variance between the elements. Regardless, it is clear that at an uncertainty of around 1.25 Gyr (or 25\%) the r-value begins to increase. At the next interval of around 0.75 Gyr (or 15\%) there is a very rapid increase in confidence. This informs us that ideally, we are striving for an uncertainty of less than 15\%, which is significantly lower than the uncertainties we are working with at the moment.

% \SB{I believe we should rather perform some MC simulations of relative abundance and age uncertainties. We can do that quite simple by multiplying the ages by a factor that is sampled from a normal distribution around 1 with a scatter value, e.g. 0.15 - is 0.15 corresponding to 15\% uncertainty?}

% \textbf{Key Takeaways:} We can quantify the results and determine exactly what level of noise and age uncertainty is permissible to be able to separate the populations with 68\% and 95\% confidence. 

\subsection{Investigating the age-abundance sequences of the simulations}\label{sec:uncertainties}

Plotting elemental abundance vs age in Fig. \ref{fig:BaFetime} and \ref{fig:BaHtime} showed three distinct streams in the simulated plots. We explore these populations more closely here, and examine how these three populations appear in dynamical and chemical space as well. This is clearly laid out in Fig. \ref{fig:NaFe_MgMn_selection_Age_FeH_dissection}, showing the three population streams of the simulated galaxy in abundance-age plots in three distinct colours. These subsections are then considered in dynamical terms: considering where the stars lie in terms of galactic height against radius. We see that the in-situ stars (blue) are situated mostly around the Galactic plane, as expected. As we also expect, the population known to be accreted (red) has significantly more scatter in its spatial distribution, however the stars are still concentrated around the same plane. This is further the case when considering the third, probably accreted, stream (purple). There is too much intrinsic overlap between the populations to distinguish three separate streams of stars in dynamical space. \par 
This is similarly the case when considering two different abundance planes: an alpha element vs metallicity and [Mg/Mn] vs [Fe/H], as explored in observations in Sec. \ref{sec:feh_xfe} and \ref{sec:alfe_mgmn}. We expect the accreted bodies of stars to have notably lower abundances of alpha elements (REF), but again there is far too much chemical overlap between the populations to confidently separate the accreted from the in-situ based on alpha elements alone. Similarly, examining the [Mg/Mn] vs [Al/Fe] plots should demonstrate the difference between elements formed by SnII and Sn1a supernovae, as Mg is formed primarily in massive stars and returned to the ISM via SNeII \citep{Kobayashi2020} and Mn is generally produced by SNe1a explosions. Again, we can identify some distinct patterns of stars in this plane, but there is significant overlap. Studying Fig. \ref{fig:NaFe_MgMn_selection_Age_FeH_dissection} shows that we cannot rely on the chemical abundance planes created from simulation data to grant significant insight into accreted and in-situ populations, as there is too much intrinsic overlap to confidently separate them. \par 
\textbf{Key Takeaway:} There is too much intrinsic overlap in the dynamic and chemical properties of the accreted and in-situ populations identified in the simulation data to confidently distinguish different populations from these plots.

\subsection{The potential of age to clean chemical selections}

% Select stars in a rectangle locations of [Na/Fe] vs. [Mg/Mn] and then plot the ones with a below a certain Age-[Fe/H] relation in left panels and those above in the right panels of Fig.~\ref{fig:NaFe_MgMn_selection_Age_FeH_dissection}.

From the simulated galaxy, and the findings displayed in Fig \ref{fig:BaFetime}, \ref{fig:BaHtime} and \ref{fig:NaFe_MgMn_selection_Age_FeH_dissection}, we can apply our knowledge of how we expect accretion to appear in element vs abundance plots to 'clean' the observations, to an extent. We know that we expect to see (at least) two distinct streams in the [Fe/H] vs age plots. We are currently limited by very large age uncertainties in GALAH age measurements, so these populations are difficult to determine in our current observational plots (Figs. \ref{fig:BaFetime} and \ref{fig:BaHtime}). However, using the simulated plots to inform our expectations of the trends and substructure, we can explore the GALAH data more thoroughly. Expecting two distinct streams in age-abundance plots means we can correlate age-abundance  with abundance-abundance plots, to refine populations in chemical space. \par 
This is shown in Fig \ref{fig:NaFe_MgMn_selection_Age_FeH} where the different coloured sections correspond to increasingly large selections of stars in the [Mg/Mn] vs [Na/Fe] plane. We see that the smallest subset (red) has two clearly defined populations where we expect the accreted and in-situ stars to be. The significance and clarity of separation between the two populations decreases as the selection size increases (moving to the right across the figure). The blue subset, for example, shows no hint of two distinct populations. We can now determine how selective we need to be in the observational abundance-abundance plots in order to identify two clear populations. \par 
\textbf{Key Takeaway:} We can use the simulation abundance-age plots to clean our selection of chemical abundance plots from the observational data.

\section{Discussion} \label{sec:discussion}
The initial motivation of this research was to create a variety of abundance planes and compare them using both the simulated and observed data to determine the best abundance-abundance plots for identifying substructure that could be representative of an accreted population of stars. Upon doing so, and observing very little distinct substructure in the simulated plots, these methods were deemed insufficient to confidently report any results. Due to the lack of potential observational uncertainties in the simulations, we expected to find significantly clearer substructure and distinct populations than had already been identified in observations \citep{Buder2022}. The fact that this wasn’t the case indicated a potential underlying problem in the theory behind this undertaking.  \par 
Beyond a lack of observational errors, one of the key advantages of the simulations is that we know the exact history of formation and accretion  of the simulated galaxy. Unfortunately, we do not yet have the same level of certainty surrounding our own Galaxy’s evolution. We know that the simulations are based on a merger event that occurred 5Gyr after formation, when a galaxy around $10e9 M_{\odot}$ merged with an in situ galaxy of around $10e10 M_{\odot}$. %These values that have been estimated to the order of magnitude by multiplying the number of star particles with their average stellar mass for each sequence of the simulation.
Although we do not know the exact sizes or times of accretion events in the Milky Way, the GSE is estimated to be between 108.7 and 109.85 $M_{\odot}$ (Helmi et al. 2018; Naidu et al. 2020), which highlights a possible discrepancy between the simulations and the observations. Even a small deviation in evolution could lead to vastly different outcomes, and could explain the discrepancy between observed substructure in the Milky Way, and the lack thereof in the simulated galaxy. Until we can be more confident regarding the history of our Milky Way, this will remain a significant shortcoming of using simulations in this way. \par 
The lack of reportable findings from comparing abundance-abundance planes led to a shift in focus. As discussed in Sec. \ref{sec:intro}, one of the key advantages to chemical tagging is the unchanging nature of stellar chemistry over time. This means that a star’s current chemical make-up is indicative of the time and place that it was born. Therefore plotting elemental abundance over time was hypothesised as a good indicator of accretion, as populations of different chemistry should emerge as the galaxy evolves. This was plotted and analysed in Section \ref{sec:Age-abundance}. We see three clear populations emerge in the simulations, highlighted in Fig \ref{fig:NaFe_MgMn_selection_Age_FeH_dissection}. \par 
Again, it is important to note that the simulated galaxy may have different characteristics to our own Galaxy. As discussed, there are two clear streams that have been attributed as accreted and in situ, based on the assumption that the accreted stars would have been born in a smaller galaxy with less massive stars and therefore lower element abundances. This clarity occurs because we know the sizes of the two galaxies that merged. Depending on the size of the real merger in the Milky Way, there could be significantly more overlap between the accreted and in situ populations if the merger was more massive. Even within the simulated data, we see significant overlap in the kinematic and chemical characteristics of the three separate streams, which is clear in Fig \ref{fig:NaFe_MgMn_selection_Age_FeH_dissection}. This indicates that within the simulated data, and potentially the real Milky Way, there may be significant uncertainty in distinguishing between the accreted and in situ populations, using the dynamic or chemical information. \par 
However, there is potential in using the simulations to ‘clean up’ the observational data. In assessment of Fig. \ref{fig:BaFetime} and \ref{fig:BaHtime}, we see large amounts of scatter in the observations. However, there is a hint of an overdensity toward the bottom right of the plot, which could be indicative of an accreted population. Applying the quality cute provided with the GALAH data had little effect on the clarity of this overdensity, but with better quality cuts, more time and expertise- and better data- this ‘hint’ could start looking more like what is shown in the observations.\par 
I would strongly recommend that similar research is performed with other cosmological simulations, preferably with varied chemistry and formation histories. This would enable researchers to observe exactly how different variables in the simulation affect outcomes. More importantly, the research was limited by the uncertainties present in the observations, especially in the ages. If the error margins corresponding to age measurements can be drastically reduced, we have found that plotting element abundance over age holds significant potential for the identification of accreted stars. \par 




% This project began with the intention of creating a variety of abundance planes and comparing both simulation and observation data to identify substructure within the plots that was representative of accreted stars. Upon doing so, and observing very little clear substructure in the simulation plots, these plots were deemed insufficient to confidently report any results. There are two major advantages to using cosmological simulations. The first of these is that there are no measurement uncertainties to consider, which should produce clear and accurate plots with no doubt of extrinsic scatter. This means that although some distinct populations were seen in the observational plots, the absence of clarity in the simulation-based plots questions that measurement uncertainties are the main difference between observations and simulations.   
% Beyond measurement uncertainties, the second key advantage to the cosmological simulations is that the exact, detailed formation history of the simulated galaxy is known. Knowing what merged with the galaxy and when is crucial in identifying accretion, but this is knowledge that we don't possess to a desirable level for the Milky Way in reality. This poses a challenge in how we can use the cosmological simulations, as we have no guarantee that we are simulating the evolution of the Milky Way. It may also contribute to the discrepancies between the simulations and observations. If the simulations are replicating even a slightly different galaxy, this could explain the lack of clear substructure that we can see in observations. We know that the simulations are based on a merger event that occurred 5Gyr after formation, when a galaxy around $10^9 M_{\odot}$ merged with an in situ galaxy of around $10^{10} M_{\odot}$, values that have been estimated to the order of magnitude by multiplying the number of star particles with their average stellar mass for each sequence of the simulation. Although we do not know the exact sizes or times of accretion events in the Milky Way, the GSE is estimated to be between $10^{8.7}$ and $10^{9.85}\,M_{\odot}$ \citep{Helmi2018,Naidu2020}, which highlights a possible discrepancy between the simulations and the observations. Until we have a more exact understanding of the formation history of the Milky Way, we cannot ensure these simulations are accurate, which is an important caveat to keep in mind.   
% From this, the focus of the project underwent a shift, looking instead at other observables beyond chemical abundance that could be used and plotted to identify accreted stars. As Section \ref{sec:intro} makes clear, one of the key advantages to chemical tagging is the unchanging nature of stellar chemistry over time, meaning that a star's current chemical make-up is indicative of the time and place that it was born. Therefore, plotting elemental abundance over time was hypothesised as a good indicator of accretion, where separate populations should be clear. This was plotted and analysed in Section \ref{sec:ageabundance}, and found that indeed there are two clear stellar populations in the simulation data, indicative of accreted and in situ stars, that were not seen in the observational data due to measurement uncertainties.  
% Despite this positive outcome, it is still important to address the possibility of intrinsic overlap between accreted and in situ stars. As discussed, there are two clear streams that have been attributed as accreted and in situ, based on the assumption that the accreted stars would have been born in a smaller galaxy with less massive stars and therefore lower element abundances. This clarity occurs because we know the sizes of the two galaxies that merged. Depending on the size of the real merger in the Milky Way, there could be significantly more overlap between the accreted and in situ populations if the merger was more massive. This means that from the abundance-age plots alone, it is harder to tell if the situ stream is completely made up of Milky Way-born stars. 

% A further recommendation is that it would be worth putting effort into further analysing Fig.~\ref{fig:BaHtime}. Despite the massive amount of scatter in the observations, when Ba was plotted in a ratio with H, there appears to be a hint of an overdensity toward the bottom right of the plot, which could indicate an accreted population. Applying the quality cuts provided in the GALAH data had little effect on how clear this overdensity appears. It is beyond the scope of this project, but with better quality cuts, more time and expertise - and better data, this 'hint' could start indicating something that looks more like the simulations, which would further confirm that plots of elements against time are worth pursuing.  
% This project was limited by a number of variables, one of which was simply the number of elements that could be analysed. The caveat for an element to be used in this project was that it had to be included in the datasets of both the simulations, and the GALAH survey. This reduced the total number of elements to just ten. Moreover, although there were quite a number of iron-peak elements, the remaining element groups only contained two options, with Ba being the only neutron capture element. This reduced the ability to make in-depth assessments based on element groups, as the sample size was simply not large enough to consider any trends with certainty. To this end, it could be worth pursuing other datasets with a different choice of elements.  
% Moreover, I would strongly recommend similar research is performed with other cosmological simulations, preferably with varied chemistry and formation histories. This would enable researchers to observe exactly how different variables in the simulation affect outcomes. 
% The main observational limitation to this project was simply measurement uncertainties, particularly in ages. If the errors corresponding to age measurements can be drastically reduced, plotting elements over time has the potential to be a great diagnostic tool for accreted stars.

\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conc}

The aim of this paper was to determine the best diagnostic plots for identifying accreted stars in the Milky Way, through comparison of a cosmological simulation from the NIHAO suite and data from the GALAH survey. 

\SB{Absence of features does not mean that they are not present! We initially thought that the chemical abundance planes of the simulation possessed too much intrinsic overlap to be useful to this particular endeavour. But that was based on diagnostic plots for the whole galaxy!}

Plotting elemental abundances against age instead proved fruitful. Very distinct stellar streams representing accreted and in-situ stars were clear in the simulated age plots that were not apparent in the observation-based plots, due to the massive uncertainties that come with the probabilistic nature of estimating stellar ages through isochrone fitting. We found therefore that the best plots from the simulations to identify accretion were elemental abundances, relative to H, against stellar age. \par 
Adding noise to the simulated data suggests that we will be able to more confidently tell apparent accreted structures once we can determine ages within an uncertainty of 15\% and can measure elemental abundances [X/H] of accreted structures as good as $\sigma_{obs}\sim0.40$ dex. We determined that although there were three clear population streams apparent in the simulated data, significant overlap appeared when these were plotted in terms of dynamical and chemical properties. Instead, we have shown how the simulations may be used to clarify the observational plots. We conclude that this study holds exciting prospects for the future of our understanding of accretion in the Milky Way. As our observational data continues to improve, we will increase our confidence in recognising accreted stars in our own Galaxy. 

\SB{NOTE TO OURSELVES: We see this interesting prediction of high [Ba/Fe] for the youngest accreted stars in both observations and simulations! That is quite remarkable and can maybe help us to study the influence of AGB stars in the metal-poor regime?!}

\SB{Future Analysis:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Age and abundance precision for different 25ish NIHAO sims
\item Age and abundance precision for different yields
\end{itemize}

\SB{Selection does not affect the age-metallicity relations, but definitely the [Al/Fe] vs. [Mg/Mn] plane! Just because don't something in one the planes does not mean it's not there!}


\SB{These observations of stellar and gaseous components complement the advancements from the modelling perspective, where recent studies have found significant impacts of massive mergers on the cold gas metallicity gradients \citep{Buck2023}. \citet{Buck2023} analyse the impact of mergers on the abundance gradients for example in the age-metallicity relation. Also cite Agertz etc.}

% The aim of this project was to determine suitable diagnostic plots for identifying accreted stars in our Milky Way, through comparison of a cosmological simulation from the NIHAO suite with data from the GALAH survey. The major take-aways from this undertaking were:
% \begin{itemize}
% \item Chemical abundance planes of the simulations possess too much intrinsic overlap to be useful to this particular research project. 
% \item Plotting elemental abundances against age however, proved fruitful, with very distinct streams representing accreted and in situ populations appearing in the simulation data. These clear streams were not apparent in the observation-based plots, as a result of massive uncertainties that come with the probabilistic nature of estimating stellar ages through isochrone fitting.
% \item Elemental abundances as relative to H (rather than Fe) produced more significant separations between in-situ and accreted sequences as a function of stellar age.
% \item Our tests of adding noise to simulated data suggest, that we will be able to more easily tell apart accreted structures, once we undergo a critical age uncertainty of 15\% and can measure elemental abundances [X/H] of accreted structures as good as $\sigma_\text{obs} \sim 0.40\,\mathrm{dex}$.
% \end{itemize}

% Overall, reducing uncertainties in ages is a difficult task that may take a long time, but as data and techniques continue to improve these values, there is much potential in using plots of elemental abundances over time as a diagnostic tool for accreted stars.
